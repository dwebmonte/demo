One of the main avenues in the capital Caracas was sealed off, commemorative videos for the National Guard&rsquo;s 81st anniversary flashed on a big screen, and a suited Maduro with a yellow, blue and red presidential sash spoke surrounded by the military&rsquo;s top brass. But just when the leftist leader was wrapping up by vowing OPEC member Venezuela&rsquo;s stricken economy would recover, his wife Cilia Flores scanned the sky, seemingly alarmed. An explosion rocked the event close to the presidential stage, according to the government and three witnesses.  Maduro&rsquo;s wife recoiled, the camera shook, the state TV broadcast&rsquo;s audio was cut, and the camera abruptly panned out to hundreds of soldiers in sharp formation. But the image of martial lockstep was quickly shattered when a second drone hit a building nearby, as scores of soldiers scurried away before the live transmission ended and switched to reruns about the South American country&rsquo;s car census. &ldquo;This incident does make Maduro appear vulnerable but the truth remains that his circle has the power to crack down on enemies because they still control all the levers of power,&rdquo; said Raul Gallegos, associate director with the consultancy Control Risks.  &ldquo;Whatever frailty comes across is compensated by the excuse Maduro now has to crack down on his internal enemies real or perceived,&rdquo; Gallegos said. The incident failed to generate any wave of spontaneous support from traditional government backers, many of whom are reeling from hyperinflation, frequent water and power cuts, and food shortages. Still, the government&rsquo;s adversaries warned of a possible crackdown after Maduro accused opponents of seeking to assassinate him with drones. Six people were detained as suspects, Venezuelan officials said on Sunday.  The suspects launched two drones laden with explosives over the outdoor rally, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said. One was &ldquo;diverted&rdquo; by security forces while the second fell on its own and hit an apartment building, Reverol said. Maduro initially blamed outgoing Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and residents of the U.S. state of Florida for the attack. Colombia&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry in response said it &ldquo;emphatically rejected&rdquo; Maduro&rsquo;s accusations. Venezuelan cartoonist EDO published a drawing showing terrified soldiers fleeing under the tagline &ldquo;Run Forrest, the Empire is invading us!&rdquo;, in allusion to the film &lsquo;Forrest Gump&rsquo; where Tom Hanks&rsquo; character jogs across the United States.  &ldquo;The stampede of the military personnel, broadcast live, leaves the armed forces and the military top brass looking very bad,&rdquo; said Hebert Garcia Plaza, a former general and member of Maduro&rsquo;s administration who turned on the government. Open calls for military intervention have grown after  massive anti-government protests last year failed to unseat Maduro and he was re-elected in a May vote widely decried as a sham. Scores of soldiers have been detained on accusations of conspiring against Maduro or deserting, as they too sometimes struggle to eat three square meals a day.       Last year, a rogue Venezuelan police officer hijacked a helicopter and fired at government buildings in what he said was an action against a dictator. The officer was hunted down and killed by Venezuelan forces. But in public, the top brass remains fiercely loyal to Maduro, a 55-year-old former bus driver and union leader who unlike his predecessor Hugo Chavez does not hail from the military.  As the economic crisis has worsened and his popularity has slipped, Maduro has handed the military sway over the lucrative mining, oil, and food import sectors to help keep his grip on power. A little-known group called the &ldquo;National Movement of Soldiers in T-shirts&rdquo; claimed responsibility for Saturday&rsquo;s explosion. The group, which describes itself as uniting members of &ldquo;the resistance&rdquo; to Maduro, said it had planned to fly two drones but that snipers shot them down.  Maduro can take some solace in that a half-dozen bodyguards dashed on stage to cover him with bulletproof panels. A voice was heard saying &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go, my leader&rdquo; right before he was rushed away.  &ldquo;That drone was coming for me but there was a shield of love,&rdquo; Maduro said on Saturday night. &ldquo;I am sure I will live for many more years.&rdquo; "},"167139e9cbbf56fbe9c1d600c8c62620":{"title":"Twenty killed in plane crash in Swiss Alps","text":"FLIMS, Switzerland (Reuters) - All 20 people on board were killed when a small vintage plane crashed in the Swiss Alps, police said on Sunday. Three Austrians and 17 Swiss were on board the trimotor JU-52 aircraft, built in the late 1930&rsquo;s as a military aircraft and later used to operate scenic and charter flights, when it crashed shortly before 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Saturday on the west side of the Piz Segnas mountain in the canton of Grissons. The plane had been returning from Locarno near Switzerland&rsquo;s southern border. Related CoverageVintage plane&#x27;s crash in Switzerland killed all 20 on board, police say Police said those killed were couples from the Swiss cantons of Zurich, Thurgau, Lucerne, Schwyz, Zug and Vaud, along with a three-member family from Austria and three crew members from Thurgau and Zurich. &ldquo;Yesterday was the worst day in the 36-year history of JU-Air,&rdquo; the airline&rsquo;s Chief Executive Kurt Waldmeier said at a news conference in nearby Flims on Sunday. &ldquo;We have all suffered a very great loss.&rdquo; Police said they were not aware of any distress call and had not yet determined the cause of the crash, which occurred hours after a family of four was killed when their small plane went down further west in the Alps. The investigation, complicated by the vintage plane&rsquo;s lack of a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; flight recorder, will take several days. &ldquo;One can ascertain that the aircraft hit the ground nearly vertically at high speed,&rdquo; Daniel Knecht, who heads the aviation division of the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board, said.  Established in 1982, JU-Air offered sightseeing, charter and adventure flights with its three mid-century Junkers Ju-52 aircraft decommissioned by the Swiss Air Force and known affectionately in German as &ldquo;Auntie Ju&rdquo; planes. It was the first time the airline had experienced an accident that resulted in death or injury to passengers or crew members, Waldmeier said. The airline suspended flights until further notice. The plane that crashed had its last maintenance check in late July, Waldmeier said, at which time no defects had been found. Slideshow (6 Images)  The wreckage of the plane was in a basin at 2,450 meters (8,000 feet) above sea level surrounded on three sides by peaks, a Reuters witness said. Rescuers and helicopters were at the scene. The airspace above the crash site was closed by the Federal Office for Civil Aviation and access to popular hiking trails in the surrounding area was blocked. "},"05d4fa34474b2c083a4dca72153f4191":{"title":"Apparent attack in Venezuela highlights risk of drone strikes","text":"(Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro accused political foes of trying to kill him during an open-air speech on Saturday using explosive-laden drones, prompting a host of questions about the alleged attack and who might have been behind it. Wherever the investigation leads, Maduro&rsquo;s allegations raised the specter of unmanned aerial vehicles being used by militant groups or others to launch bombing, chemical or biological attacks, a tactic that has long worried security experts. The market for commercial drones has flourished in recent years amid widespread availability and falling prices. So-called &ldquo;quadcopters&rdquo; \u2013 drones with four rotors \u2013 that can be operated from more than a mile away and can fly for more than 20 minutes on one charge cost less than $1,000 to buy online, though they are generally capable of carrying only a limited payload. Militant groups such as Islamic State have used drones to carry out attacks by dropping grenades or crashing into infrastructure. There have also been incidents that raised the possibility of attacks on heads of state. In January 2015, a drone crashed onto the White House lawn after its operator lost control, prompting concerns that the U.S. president&rsquo;s home could be vulnerable. Venezuela's Interior and Justice Minister Nestor Reverol speaks during a news conference in Caracas, Venezuela August 5, 2018. Ministry of Interior and Justice\/Handout via REUTERS  A few months later, a man protesting against Japan&rsquo;s nuclear policy dropped a drone carrying radioactive sand from the Fukushima nuclear disaster onto the prime minister&rsquo;s office, though the amount of radiation was minimal. Last month, Saudi Arabian security forces shot down a recreational drone near a royal palace, briefly prompting speculation of a coup attempt. Some activist groups have also used drones to underscore their message. In July, the environmental justice group Greenpeace crashed a Superman-shaped drone into a French nuclear plant to demonstrate its vulnerability to attacks.  There is no known precedent of armed drones being used in Venezuela, though simple recreational drones have become common for photos and video production. They have become increasingly popular at opposition rallies to document the number of people present, which is frequently a subject of heated debate between supporters and adversaries of the government. Government regulations around the globe have struggled to keep up with the rapid proliferation of commercially available drones, according to Colin Clarke, an analyst with policy think tank the RAND Corporation. &ldquo;The facts on the ground far outpace law, policy and authority,&rdquo; he said. &lsquo;VERY SERIOUS, LOOMING THREAT&rsquo; In the United States, officials have warned that existing law does not adequately protect against possible crimes using unmanned aircraft systems, or UAS, including conventional attacks, cyberattacks, drug smuggling and surveillance. Slideshow (2 Images)  &ldquo;This is a very serious, looming threat that we are currently unprepared to confront,&rdquo; two top officials with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, David Glawe and Hayley Chang, wrote in testimony to Congress in June, seeking more power to track and disable drones. &ldquo;Today we are unable to effectively counter malicious use of drones because we are hampered by federal laws enacted years before UAS technology was available for commercial and consumer use.&rdquo; But civil liberties advocates oppose granting the government broad authority to strike drones preemptively, citing potential overreach. Many counter-drone systems, such as &ldquo;jammers&rdquo; intended to sever the link between an operator and a vehicle, may be difficult to deploy in non-combat zones because of the risk that they could interfere with crucial communications like commercial aircraft or law enforcement channels, according to Dan Gettinger, co-director of the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College (CSD). &ldquo;There are a number of challenges to deploying these measures in the domestic space,&rdquo; Gettinger said. A report by the center recently identified more than 200 anti-drone systems on the market, aimed at either detection or interdiction. The Federal Aviation Administration has adopted some rules governing drone use, including issuing licenses and restricting airspace. More than 100,000 remote pilot certificates have been granted by the FAA since new regulations went into effect in August 2016. The U.S. Department of Defense sought $1 billion for counter-drone measures in its proposed 2019 budget, according to the CSD. There are limits to the likely impact of any drone attack launched by non-state actors. In a recent post, Scott Stewart, an analyst with the global security consulting firm Stratfor, wrote that military ordnance or military-caliber drones are extremely difficult to obtain, while homemade explosives are typically far less lethal. But experts say the psychological effects of a small but successful attack could far outstrip the actual physical damage, accomplishing the goal of spreading terror that many militant groups such as Islamic State and al Qaeda have made their mission. &ldquo;With a Twitter account and a toy drone, you can really cause a lot of panic these days,&rdquo; Clarke said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big part of terrorism \u2013 the psychological aspect. Even if you can&rsquo;t kill large numbers of people, you can still cause fear.&rdquo; "},"ae6ce46b170824432fcabcf1ac940152":{"title":"Venezuela arrests six over drone explosions during Maduro speech","text":"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan authorities said on Sunday they have detained six people over drone explosions the day before at a rally led by President Nicolas Maduro, as his critics warned the socialist leader would use the incident to crack down on adversaries. The suspects launched two drones laden with explosives over an outdoor rally Maduro was holding in downtown Caracas to commemorate the National Guard, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said. One was &ldquo;diverted&rdquo; by security forces while the second fell on its own and hit an apartment building, Reverol said. The attack highlights Maduro&rsquo;s challenges in maintaining control over the OPEC nation, where widespread food and medicine shortages have fueled outrage and despair everywhere from hillside slums to military barracks.  &ldquo;These terrorist acts represent a slap in the face to the expressed desire of the President of the Republic, Nicolas Maduro, for national reconciliation and dialogue,&rdquo; Reverol said in a statement read on state television. State television footage of the rally showed Maduro startled by what appeared to be an explosion and footage later panned to soldiers lined up on a boulevard who chaotically broke ranks in what appeared to be a reaction to a second blast. The president later described the attack, which injured seven soldiers, as an assassination attempt. One of the suspects had an outstanding arrest warrant for involvement in a 2017 attack on a military base that killed two people, Reverol said, an incident that followed four months of anti-government protests. A second suspect had been detained during a wave of anti-Maduro protests in 2014 but had been released through &ldquo;procedural benefits,&rdquo; Reverol said, without offering details. Related CoverageApparent attack in Venezuela highlights risk of drone strikes He did not name the suspects. The arrests suggest the attack was less a military uprising than an assault led by groups linked to anti-Maduro street protesters, dubbed &ldquo;The Resistance,&rdquo; who have led two waves of violent demonstrations that left hundreds dead.  That is consistent with the shadowy group that claimed responsibility for the attack, The National Movement of Soldiers in T-Shirts, whose website says it was created in 2014 to bring together different groups of protesters.  Reuters was unable to independently confirm the involvement of the group, which did not respond to requests for comment on the arrest announcements, or identify any of its members. &lsquo;I SAW THE LITTLE PLANE&rsquo;  Bolivar Avenue of downtown Caracas, where the incident took place, was calm on Sunday. Joggers and cyclists were taking up two of the lanes that are traditionally used for weekend recreation. The stage where Maduro spoke had been removed.  Witnesses said they heard and felt an explosion in the late afternoon, then saw a drone fall out of the sky and hit a nearby building. &ldquo;I heard the first explosion, it was so strong that the buildings moved,&rdquo; said Mairum Gonzalez, 45, a pre-school teacher. &ldquo;I went to the balcony and I saw the little plane ... it hit the building and smoke started to come out.&rdquo; Two witnesses said they later saw security forces halt a black Chevrolet and arrest three men inside it.  The security forces later took apart the car and found what appeared to be remote controls, tablets and computers, said the two, who identified themselves as Andres and Karina, without giving their last names.  Opposition critics accuse Maduro of fabricating or exaggerating security incidents to distract from hyperinflation and Soviet-style product shortages.  Leopoldo Lopez, formerly mayor of Caracas&rsquo; district of Chacao, for example, is under house arrest for his role in 2014 street protests that Maduro described as a coup attempt but his adversaries insisted were a form of free expression. &ldquo;We warn that the government is taking advantage of this incident ... to criminalize those who legitimately and democratically oppose it and deepen the repression and systematic human rights violations,&rdquo; wrote the Broad Front opposition coalition in a statement published on Twitter. Maduro&rsquo;s allies counter that the opposition has a history of involvement in military conspiracies, most notably in the 2002 coup that briefly toppled socialist leader Hugo Chavez.  &ldquo;I have no doubt that everything points to the right, the Venezuelan ultra-right,&rdquo; Maduro said on Saturday night. &ldquo;Maximum punishment! And there will be no forgiveness.&rdquo;  Maduro, who blames the country&rsquo;s problems on an &ldquo;economic war&rdquo; led by adversaries, during the course of his five-year rule has often announced having foiled military plots against him that he says are backed by Washington. U.S. national security adviser John Bolton told Fox News in an interview on Sunday that the United States was not involved in the blast.

Slideshow (5 Images)  Intelligence and security sources told Reuters in 2016 that police had arrested Regeni outside a Cairo metro station on Jan. 25 of that year and then transferred him to a compound run by Homeland Security. Egyptian officials have denied any involvement and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said last month that Egypt was determined to conclude a joint investigation and bring Regeni&rsquo;s killers to justice. In a joint press conference with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry in Cairo on Sunday, Italian Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi expressed confidence in the ongoing investigation.       &ldquo;We appreciate the excellent cooperation that we have seen between the judiciaries of both countries and we are confident that justice will come to light on this painful issue,&rdquo; Moavero Milanesi said in comments broadcast on state television in Arabic translation. &ldquo;I was pleased to hear from the Egyptian minister of the strong will on the part of the Egyptian government to achieve concrete results from the judicial investigations,&rdquo; he said. Egyptian and Italian investigators have been working together to retrieve CCTV recordings from Cairo metro stations. They said in June they had found gaps in the footage and were trying to discover the cause. Italy is an important trade partner for Egypt, with 4.75 billion euros ($5.5 billion) in trade per year according to Egypt&rsquo;s foreign ministry. Italian oil major Eni (ENI.MI ) is among Egypt&rsquo;s top foreign investors. Though no new agreements were announced, Moavero Milanesi spoke of the countries&rsquo; cooperation on migration, an issue that has dominated Italian politics since hundreds of thousands of migrants landed on Italy&rsquo;s shores in recent years, helping bring Italy&rsquo;s anti-establishment government to power in June.

The Mendocino Complex Fire, made up of two separate conflagrations that merged near Ukiah, north of Sacramento, exploded by 25 percent overnight and had blackened nearly 400 square miles as of Sunday morning, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. &ldquo;The Mendocino Complex Fire has charred more than 254,000 acres, making it the fifth largest blaze in California&rsquo;s history,&rdquo; AccuWeather said on its website. &ldquo;Firefighters will continue to face local gusty winds and building heat this week.&rdquo; The Mendocino is one of 17 major wildfires burning across California that prompted U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday to declare a &ldquo;major disaster&rdquo; in the state, ordering federal funding to be made available to help recovery efforts. &ldquo;Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property loses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,&rdquo; the White House said in a written statement. The PG&E Corporation said on Sunday that a 21-year-old apprentice lineman, Jay Ayeta, had been killed when his vehicle crashed in western Shasta County as he worked with crews in dangerous terrain to battle the nearly two-week-old Carr Fire.  Ayeta was the seventh person to die in that blaze, which has scorched more than 154,000 acres in the scenic Shasta-Trinity region north of Sacramento, including two young children and their great-grandmother whose home was overrun by flames, a resident who authorities said refused to leave his home despite evacuation orders, and two firefighters.  Firefighters had managed to contain 41 percent of the Carr blaze by Sunday, and authorities were letting some evacuees return. This year, California wildfires have burned more land earlier in the fire season than usual, Cal Fire director Ken Pimlott said during a news conference on Saturday. &ldquo;Fire season is really just beginning. What seems like we should be in the peak of fire season, historically, is really now the kind of conditions we&rsquo;re seeing really at the beginning,&rdquo; he said. Through last week, California fires had torched about 290,000 acres (117,300 hectares), more than double the five-year average over that same period, according to Cal Fire.

President Donald Trump&rsquo;s decision to pull out of an agreement to lift sanctions in return for Iran limiting its nuclear programme caused a run on the rial as companies and savers bought hard currency to protect themselves from the economic sanctions that could be imposed from Monday. The plunge in the currency and soaring inflation have sparked sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans. The central bank has blamed &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; for the fall of the currency, and the judiciary said 29 people had been arrested on charges that carry the death penalty. On Sunday the judiciary said it had arrested a further seven people, including a former deputy central bank governor and five foreign exchange dealers. A state body led by President Hassan Rouhani and including the heads of the judiciary and parliament on Sunday partially lifted a ban on the sale of foreign currency at floating rates, allowing exchange bureaux to sell at unofficial market rates for purposes such as overseas travel.  That reverses the decision in April to ban trading currency outside the rate of about 42,000 rials to the dollar  Ahead of the announcement of the new measures, the rial gained slightly on the unofficial market, trading at 98,500 to the dollar, compared with 103,000 on Saturday, according to foreign exchange website Boncast.com. Central bank governor Abdolnaser Hemmati said the plan reflected Iran&rsquo;s self-confidence in the face of the looming U.S. sanctions. FILE PHOTO: Iranian President Hassan Rouhani disembarks from a plane upon his arrival at the airport in Zurich, Switzerland, July 2, 2018. REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo &ldquo;This shows our power. The same day you (Americans) impose sanctions we open our economy. We have no problems, so why should our people worry?,&rdquo; Hemmati said in a live televised interview.  Hemmati said the central bank would allow a &ldquo;managed float&rdquo; of the rial&rsquo;s exchange rate and try to avoid using up its reserves to support the currency. &ldquo;The central bank will try not to interfere in setting the price of hard currencies, which will be determined by supply and demand, however, the bank&rsquo;s supervision will prevent unbridled (market swings) and the creation of a black market,&rdquo; Hemmati said. To encourage Iranians to return their hard cash to the economy, the plan allows the central bank to set up dollar savings accounts for ordinary people, state television said. Non-oil exporters will be allowed to sell hard currency to importers, and there will be no limit on bringing currency or gold into the country. Hard currency will be made available at a subsidised rate for purchases of basic goods and medicine, state television quoted a government statement about the plan as saying. In July, Iran opened a secondary foreign-exchange market for importers of non-essential goods that are not eligible to receive the preferential rate from the central bank. Starting this week, Washington will re-impose sanctions on Iran&rsquo;s purchases of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals, and its dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software. The United States has told third countries they must halt imports of Iranian oil from early November or face U.S. financial measures.

One of the main avenues in the capital Caracas was sealed off, commemorative videos for the National Guard&rsquo;s 81st anniversary flashed on a big screen, and a suited Maduro with a yellow, blue and red presidential sash spoke surrounded by the military&rsquo;s top brass. But just when the leftist leader was wrapping up by vowing OPEC member Venezuela&rsquo;s stricken economy would recover, his wife Cilia Flores scanned the sky, seemingly alarmed. An explosion rocked the event close to the presidential stage, according to the government and three witnesses.  Maduro&rsquo;s wife recoiled, the camera shook, the state TV broadcast&rsquo;s audio was cut, and the camera abruptly panned out to hundreds of soldiers in sharp formation. But the image of martial lockstep was quickly shattered when a second drone hit a building nearby, as scores of soldiers scurried away before the live transmission ended and switched to reruns about the South American country&rsquo;s car census. &ldquo;This incident does make Maduro appear vulnerable but the truth remains that his circle has the power to crack down on enemies because they still control all the levers of power,&rdquo; said Raul Gallegos, associate director with the consultancy Control Risks.  &ldquo;Whatever frailty comes across is compensated by the excuse Maduro now has to crack down on his internal enemies real or perceived,&rdquo; Gallegos said. The incident failed to generate any wave of spontaneous support from traditional government backers, many of whom are reeling from hyperinflation, frequent water and power cuts, and food shortages. Still, the government&rsquo;s adversaries warned of a possible crackdown after Maduro accused opponents of seeking to assassinate him with drones. Six people were detained as suspects, Venezuelan officials said on Sunday.  The suspects launched two drones laden with explosives over the outdoor rally, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said. One was &ldquo;diverted&rdquo; by security forces while the second fell on its own and hit an apartment building, Reverol said. Maduro initially blamed outgoing Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and residents of the U.S. state of Florida for the attack. Colombia&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry in response said it &ldquo;emphatically rejected&rdquo; Maduro&rsquo;s accusations. Venezuelan cartoonist EDO published a drawing showing terrified soldiers fleeing under the tagline &ldquo;Run Forrest, the Empire is invading us!&rdquo;, in allusion to the film &lsquo;Forrest Gump&rsquo; where Tom Hanks&rsquo; character jogs across the United States.  &ldquo;The stampede of the military personnel, broadcast live, leaves the armed forces and the military top brass looking very bad,&rdquo; said Hebert Garcia Plaza, a former general and member of Maduro&rsquo;s administration who turned on the government. Open calls for military intervention have grown after  massive anti-government protests last year failed to unseat Maduro and he was re-elected in a May vote widely decried as a sham. Scores of soldiers have been detained on accusations of conspiring against Maduro or deserting, as they too sometimes struggle to eat three square meals a day.       Last year, a rogue Venezuelan police officer hijacked a helicopter and fired at government buildings in what he said was an action against a dictator. The officer was hunted down and killed by Venezuelan forces. But in public, the top brass remains fiercely loyal to Maduro, a 55-year-old former bus driver and union leader who unlike his predecessor Hugo Chavez does not hail from the military.  As the economic crisis has worsened and his popularity has slipped, Maduro has handed the military sway over the lucrative mining, oil, and food import sectors to help keep his grip on power. A little-known group called the &ldquo;National Movement of Soldiers in T-shirts&rdquo; claimed responsibility for Saturday&rsquo;s explosion. The group, which describes itself as uniting members of &ldquo;the resistance&rdquo; to Maduro, said it had planned to fly two drones but that snipers shot them down.  Maduro can take some solace in that a half-dozen bodyguards dashed on stage to cover him with bulletproof panels. A voice was heard saying &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go, my leader&rdquo; right before he was rushed away.  &ldquo;That drone was coming for me but there was a shield of love,&rdquo; Maduro said on Saturday night. &ldquo;I am sure I will live for many more years.&rdquo; "},"c538f0fc4e1ab6c1e172cc7983c97c99":{"title":"Brazilian right-wing candidate Bolsonaro picks army general as running mate","text":"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro on Sunday tipped as his running mate a controversial retired military general who said last year that a military coup was possible in the country. General Antonio Hamilton Mour\u00e3o warned last September that the military could seize power if Brazil&rsquo;s courts do not punish corrupt politicians. Mour\u00e3o was later removed from his post as the army&rsquo;s finance chief after similar remarks that the military could step in in the event of chaos in Brazil. Going into Brazil&rsquo;s most wide open presidential election in decades, Bolsonaro leads in opinion polls that exclude jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro, running as a candidate for the small Social Liberty Party (PSL), has pegged much of his candidacy on controversial remarks, whether defending of the past military dictatorship or suggesting acts of violence against homosexuals. In an interview last year with Reuters, the candidate for the Social Liberty Party (PSL) played down Mour\u00e3o&rsquo;s remarks. &ldquo;It was just a warning. Nobody wants to seize power that way,&rdquo; Bolsonaro said. &ldquo;Maybe we could have a military man winning in 2018, but through elections.&rdquo; Bolsonaro had struggled to find a running mate as other parties tried to distance themselves from his controversial comments. Other proposed vice presidential candidates - including another general, an astronaut and a sitting senator - ultimately fell through.  Mour\u00e3o&rsquo;s selection is part of a flurry of political announcements in Brazil on Sunday, the final day for parties to choose candidates for the October election. Senator and former agriculture minister Katia Abreu accepted an offer to run alongside left-wing presidential contender Ciro Gomes of the Democratic Labor Party (PDT), according to a representative for Abreu. Gomes had sought to ally with a wide array of parties but was rebuffed, leading him to choose fellow party member Abreu as his running mate. The Workers Party said in a statement that its executive committee would meet later on Sunday to discuss Lula&rsquo;s running mate in the former leader&rsquo;s latest bid for the presidency.

(Reuters) - The president of CBS Entertainment said on Sunday that the broadcast network is committed to a safe workplace following a &ldquo;tough week&rdquo; clouded by allegations of sexual misconduct against Chief Executive Leslie Moonves.   CBS Corp (CBS.N ) executive Kelly Kahl was hit with several questions about the accusations against Moonves and the overall culture at CBS Entertainment, the unit that oversees programming for the broadcast unit, during a 25-minute session at a Television Critics Association event where networks promote upcoming shows. &ldquo;Obviously, this has been a tough week at CBS,&rdquo; Kahl said, adding that he struggled with how to express his response to a report in The New Yorker magazine on July 27 that detailed claims by six women who said Moonves sexually harassed them in incidents between 1985 and 2006. &ldquo;Leslie been an excellent boss and a mentor for a long time.

CBS hired two law firms and appointed former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White to lead a probe into the allegations and the broader culture at CBS.

Over the last year coordination centers asking rescue vessels to go on standby or wait for clarification on certain things had added to the danger of people needing to be rescued, which is why they would no longer wait, he added. The 77-metre vessel, operated by Franco-German charity SOS Mediterranee, set sail from Marseille this week on its tenth mission of the year.  The ship will be patrolling between 25-30 miles from the Libyan coast, west of Tripoli, an area that is outside Libya&rsquo;s territorial waters but inside the Libyan search and rescue region. International law states the country responsible for operations in an area has primary responsibility for disembarking rescue ships. Romaniuk said that while Aquarius would continue to abide by international maritime law, it would not be taking people back to Libya because it was not a safe place, putting it at odds with the wishes of the new Italian government. &ldquo;Libya is still not recognized as a port of safety, so (we)will not be taking people back there, because... a rescue cannot terminate in a place which is not deemed a port of safety,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It has to continue for the time being to be European ports. But again, it&rsquo;s not our decision to make, maritime authorities, they make that decision, but our red line will be not taking people back to Libya,&rdquo; he said. In the past the Aquarius has waited for orders from the responsible authorities before moving ahead to rescue migrants aiming to reach Italy from Libya.  But Italy has toughened its stance since the new government, a coalition including the anti-immigrant League party, took office earlier this year. Interior minister Matteo Salvini, leader of the League, has spearheaded a policy to shut ports to charity ships that pick up migrants from overcrowded smugglers&rsquo; boats. He now wants as many as possible to be picked up by Libyan coastguards and returned. In June, the Aquarius picked up 629 migrants off the coast of Libya, planning to take them to the nearest European port - the usual practice with such rescue missions. But the Italian government asked the ship to go to Malta rather than Italy, triggering a standoff that drew in the European Union and France. Salvini has accused SOS Mediterranee and other charities of acting like a Mediterranean &ldquo;taxi service&rdquo; for the\u00a0migrants. The Aquarius is one of a number of NGO-supported ships that have carried out rescue operations in the southern Mediterranean, alongside the Italian navy and EU-led missions. A rescue boat operated by the Spanish charity Proactiva Open Arms this week rescued 87 migrants in the southern Mediterranean in international waters. More than 10,000 migrants have drowned in the region since 2014, according to the International Organization for Migration.

The Israeli statement came hours before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his security cabinet to discuss, and possibly approve U.N.- and Egyptian-brokered ideas for preventing another threatened Gaza war. A very brief statement issued after the meeting ended revealed little. It said that Israel&rsquo;s military chief had briefed the cabinet about the situation in the Gaza Strip and that the army was &ldquo;prepared for any scenario.&rdquo; The United Nations and Egypt have not publicly detailed their proposals. They have spoken generally of a need to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza, stem cross-border hostilities and reconcile Hamas - which refuses formal peacemaking with Israel - to its Western-backed Palestinian rivals.  Gaza, under years of grinding Israeli and Egyptian sanctions aimed at isolating Hamas, has seen a surge in tensions since Palestinians launched weekly border protests on March 30, drawing Israeli army fire that has killed at least 157 people.  There have also been shelling exchanges between Hamas-led militants and Israel in which around 10 Palestinian gunmen and four civilians have died, Gaza sniper attacks that killed an Israeli soldier and wounded another, and wide-scale brushfires set in Israel by incendiary kites and helium balloons from Gaza.  Israel responded on July 9 by shuttering Gaza&rsquo;s main commercial terminal and limiting a Palestinian fishing zone off the enclave, measures it offered to reverse on Sunday.       &ldquo;A complete ceasefire (by the Palestinians) will lead, on Israel&rsquo;s part, to the reopening of the Kerem Shalom crossing and renewal of the permits given in respect to the fishing zones,&rdquo; said the Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. This offer would be the focus of Sunday&rsquo;s deliberations, the official said, adding that any eventual broader agreement over Gaza would require a guarantee for the return of the remains of two Israeli soldiers killed in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war, and two civilians lost in Gaza. Hamas has linked their fate to Israel freeing Palestinian security detainees - something many Israelis oppose.  Hamas, which convened several of its top leaders to Gaza last week for consultations, also sounded circumspect on Sunday.

REUTERS\/Amir Cohen\/File Photo &ldquo;Hamas has conducted internal meetings that have not yet ended,&rdquo; one senior official, Hussam Badran, told a Gaza radio station. &ldquo;The suffering of our people, and the 12-year blockade imposed with no guilt on their part, requires that all Palestinian leaders search for a real solution to this suffering ... without giving concessions when it comes to the known and outstanding positions and rights of our people.&rdquo; More than two million Palestinians, mostly the stateless descendants of people who were driven out or fled from territory that is now Israel at its founding in 1948, are packed into the narrow strip.  Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but maintains tight control of its land and sea borders. Egypt also restricts movement in and out of Gaza on its border. Israel, the United States and other Western countries regard Hamas as a terrorist organization. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2008, the last of them in 2014. The Fatah movement of Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas who holds sway in the Israeli-occupied West Bank has denounced the talks. A spokesman said any deal risked ending hopes of achieving Palestinian statehood. &ldquo;(A deal would bring about a) separation of Gaza from the rest of the homeland and would create a mini-state which will be the graveyard of our national project,&rdquo; said Munir Al-Ghaghoub, a spokesman for Abbas&rsquo;s Fatah movement. But after a meeting of Palestinian faction representatives including Fatah, Hamas&rsquo;s Badran said: &ldquo;There will be no state in Gaza and no state without Gaza.&rdquo; In what appeared to be a confidence-building gesture by Cairo, a pro-Hamas website said Egypt was on Sunday beginning to allow cooking gas across its border to Gaza to make up for the shortfall in Israeli supplies.    Also on Sunday, the Israeli military said it fired toward a vehicle used by Palestinian balloon-launchers in Gaza on Sunday. Palestinian medics said four people were wounded. Israel&rsquo;s Defence Ministry released first images of the barrier it has built along the border with the Gaza Strip that stretches into the sea, and which it began constructing two months ago. Built up with rocks and gravel, it stretches 200 meters from the shore into the Mediterranean. It is 50 meters wide and a six-meter high steel fence is placed next to it facing the Gaza side which will have surveillance devices placed on it.

He added, however, that the United States had been sending &ldquo;massive strategic weaponry&rdquo; into the South China Sea and the region as a show of military might that puts pressure on China and other regional countries. &ldquo;That is the biggest force behind militarization in this region,&rdquo; he said.  China and the ASEAN bloc on Thursday hailed a &ldquo;milestone&rdquo; agreement on a single working text to kick off what will likely be protracted negotiations towards a code of conduct for behavior in the disputed waters. But critics have said that this enthusiasm for talks is a means for China to buy time and solidify its position during a period of relative dominance in the region where it has built island bases on submerged reefs. Pompeo told reporters that he had raised concerns at the meeting about Chinese militarization of the South China Sea and the importance of maintaining a rules-based order. Progress towards resolving the continuing humanitarian crisis in Myanmar&rsquo;s troubled Rakhine state and other security issues were also essential to a free and open Indo-Pacific, he said. The use of &ldquo;Indo-Pacific&rdquo; has grown among diplomats from Japan, Australia, India and the Untied States in recent years, a shorthand for a democratic-led region, as opposed to an &ldquo;Asia-Pacific&rdquo; with China at its center.  China says that its Belt and Road plan is about promoting the common prosperity of all nations involved, but critics see the signature policy of President Xi Jinping as a bid for greater political clout.

Three Austrians and 17 Swiss were on board the trimotor JU-52 aircraft, built in the late 1930&rsquo;s as a military aircraft and later used to operate scenic and charter flights, when it crashed shortly before 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) on Saturday on the west side of the Piz Segnas mountain in the canton of Grissons. The plane had been returning from Locarno near Switzerland&rsquo;s southern border. Related CoverageVintage plane&#x27;s crash in Switzerland killed all 20 on board, police say Police said those killed were couples from the Swiss cantons of Zurich, Thurgau, Lucerne, Schwyz, Zug and Vaud, along with a three-member family from Austria and three crew members from Thurgau and Zurich. &ldquo;Yesterday was the worst day in the 36-year history of JU-Air,&rdquo; the airline&rsquo;s Chief Executive Kurt Waldmeier said at a news conference in nearby Flims on Sunday. &ldquo;We have all suffered a very great loss.&rdquo; Police said they were not aware of any distress call and had not yet determined the cause of the crash, which occurred hours after a family of four was killed when their small plane went down further west in the Alps. The investigation, complicated by the vintage plane&rsquo;s lack of a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; flight recorder, will take several days. &ldquo;One can ascertain that the aircraft hit the ground nearly vertically at high speed,&rdquo; Daniel Knecht, who heads the aviation division of the Swiss Transportation Safety Investigation Board, said.  Established in 1982, JU-Air offered sightseeing, charter and adventure flights with its three mid-century Junkers Ju-52 aircraft decommissioned by the Swiss Air Force and known affectionately in German as &ldquo;Auntie Ju&rdquo; planes. It was the first time the airline had experienced an accident that resulted in death or injury to passengers or crew members, Waldmeier said. The airline suspended flights until further notice. The plane that crashed had its last maintenance check in late July, Waldmeier said, at which time no defects had been found. Slideshow (6 Images)  The wreckage of the plane was in a basin at 2,450 meters (8,000 feet) above sea level surrounded on three sides by peaks, a Reuters witness said. Rescuers and helicopters were at the scene. The airspace above the crash site was closed by the Federal Office for Civil Aviation and access to popular hiking trails in the surrounding area was blocked.

Ejei did not name the official but he appeared to be referring to Ahmad Araghchi, who some media reports had said was dismissed as deputy central bank governor after a wide public outcry and street protests over a rapid fall of Iran&rsquo;s currency. The rial currency has lost about half of its value since April because of a weak economy and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who fear the effects of crippling U.S. sanctions. The central bank last week blamed &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; for the fall of the currency and a rapid rise in the prices of gold coins and the judiciary said 29 people had been arrested on charges that carry the death penalty. Besides the currency fall, the expected return of sanctions has triggered street protests and a public outcry over alleged profiteering and corruption. Ejei said a person working in a government department headed by an unnamed deputy of President Hassan Rouhani, four unauthorized foreign exchange dealers and an employee of an exchange shop were also arrested. In May, the United States pulled out of a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran under which international sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear program. Washington decided to reimpose sanctions upon its withdrawal, accusing Iran of posing a security threat. A first wave of sanctions are due after a wind-down period which expires on Aug. 6.  Washington will first reimpose sanctions on Iran&rsquo;s purchase of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals and its dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software. The United States has told countries they must halt imports of Iranian oil from early November or face U.S. financial measures. "},"847128ba7349928e042e22d409346182":{"title":"Iran eases currency rules, hoping to buoy rial ahead of sanctions","text":"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran will ease foreign exchange rules, state TV reported on Sunday, in a bid to halt a collapse of the rial currency that has lost half its value since April due to fears about U.S. sanctions likely to be imposed this week. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s decision to pull out of an agreement to lift sanctions in return for Iran limiting its nuclear programme caused a run on the rial as companies and savers bought hard currency to protect themselves from the economic sanctions that could be imposed from Monday. The plunge in the currency and soaring inflation have sparked sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans. The central bank has blamed &ldquo;enemies&rdquo; for the fall of the currency, and the judiciary said 29 people had been arrested on charges that carry the death penalty. On Sunday the judiciary said it had arrested a further seven people, including a former deputy central bank governor and five foreign exchange dealers. A state body led by President Hassan Rouhani and including the heads of the judiciary and parliament on Sunday partially lifted a ban on the sale of foreign currency at floating rates, allowing exchange bureaux to sell at unofficial market rates for purposes such as overseas travel.  That reverses the decision in April to ban trading currency outside the rate of about 42,000 rials to the dollar  Ahead of the announcement of the new measures, the rial gained slightly on the unofficial market, trading at 98,500 to the dollar, compared with 103,000 on Saturday, according to foreign exchange website Boncast.com. Central bank governor Abdolnaser Hemmati said the plan reflected Iran&rsquo;s self-confidence in the face of the looming U.S. sanctions.

REUTERS\/Arnd Wiegmann\/File Photo &ldquo;This shows our power. The same day you (Americans) impose sanctions we open our economy. We have no problems, so why should our people worry?,&rdquo; Hemmati said in a live televised interview.  Hemmati said the central bank would allow a &ldquo;managed float&rdquo; of the rial&rsquo;s exchange rate and try to avoid using up its reserves to support the currency. &ldquo;The central bank will try not to interfere in setting the price of hard currencies, which will be determined by supply and demand, however, the bank&rsquo;s supervision will prevent unbridled (market swings) and the creation of a black market,&rdquo; Hemmati said. To encourage Iranians to return their hard cash to the economy, the plan allows the central bank to set up dollar savings accounts for ordinary people, state television said. Non-oil exporters will be allowed to sell hard currency to importers, and there will be no limit on bringing currency or gold into the country. Hard currency will be made available at a subsidised rate for purchases of basic goods and medicine, state television quoted a government statement about the plan as saying. In July, Iran opened a secondary foreign-exchange market for importers of non-essential goods that are not eligible to receive the preferential rate from the central bank. Starting this week, Washington will re-impose sanctions on Iran&rsquo;s purchases of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals, and its dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software.

Vital battleground states such as Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida highlight this month&rsquo;s primaries. The final five state primaries are in early September, clearing the way for a general election campaign that has become a referendum on Republican President Donald Trump&rsquo;s chaotic first 19 months in office. Trump has endorsed a string of recent primary winners, turning many Republican races into contests over which candidate is more supportive of Trump or can earn his backing. August will provide more tests of his clout. For Democrats, several nominating contests will feature showdowns between mainstream candidates and the party&rsquo;s resurgent progressive wing, including candidates backed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to find out more this month about how powerful a Trump endorsement, or even a perceived endorsement, can be,&rdquo; said Jennifer Duffy, an analyst with the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re also going to figure out how powerful the progressive message is for Democrats.&rdquo; Democrats need to pick up 23 seats in the House of Representatives and two seats in the Senate to claim majorities in each chamber of Congress and put a brake on Trump&rsquo;s agenda. All 435 House seats and 35 of 100 Senate seats are up for grabs on Nov. 6, along with 36 of the 50 gubernatorial offices. Here is a look at some of the key races in August, and a few of the questions that could be answered this month. WHICH PRIMARIES WILL HAVE THE BIGGEST IMPACT IN NOVEMBER? The Republican U.S. Senate primaries in Arizona and Wisconsin will be crucial in the battle for control of that chamber. In Arizona, one of two top takeover opportunities for Democrats along with Nevada, a three-way Republican race features establishment favorite U.S. Representative Martha McSally against two hard-line conservatives, former state Senator Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The two conservative firebrands could split the right-wing vote in the Aug. 28 primary against the more moderate McSally. They are seen as less viable contenders against the likely Democratic nominee, U.S. Representative Kyrsten Sinema, to replace the retiring Jeff Flake in November. Trump has not endorsed anyone in the race. He also has not endorsed either of the main Republican contenders in Wisconsin&rsquo;s Aug. 14 battle for the right to challenge Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin in a state Trump narrowly won in 2016. State lawmaker Leah Vukmir and Kevin Nicholson, a former Marine and a former Democrat, are battling to prove their loyalty to the president. Democrats have several primaries in House races in districts that will be competitive in November, notably in Kansas and Washington state on Tuesday. WHERE WILL TRUMP&rsquo;S ENDORSEMENT PLAY THE BIGGEST ROLE? Trump&rsquo;s backing of Republican Representative Ron DeSantis gave the conservative congressman a huge boost in his Aug. 28 primary for the gubernatorial nomination in the important battleground state of Florida. DeSantis faces Adam Putnam, the state agriculture commissioner and a former congressman, for the nomination to replace Governor Rick Scott, who is running for the U.S. Senate. A recent DeSantis campaign ad touts his allegiance to Trump, showing him urging his toddler daughter to &ldquo;build the wall&rdquo; with toy blocks and features his baby in a red &ldquo;Make America Great Again&rdquo; onesie. WILL PROGRESSIVES NOTCH MORE BIG DEMOCRATIC WINS? The next test of the electoral power of progressive Democrats will be in Michigan, where health director Abdul El-Sayed is vying to become the country&rsquo;s first Muslim American governor. El-Sayed was endorsed by Sanders and campaigned recently with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young democratic socialist whose shocking, recent New York primary upset made her a movement star. El-Sayed has backed a state-level, single-payer healthcare system that the front-runner in the race, former state Senate Democratic leader Gretchen Whitmer, has said is not realistic. In Florida, another Sanders-backed Democrat, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, is running for governor in a crowded field that includes moderate former U.S. Representative Gwen Graham. OTHER RACES WITH PROMINENT CONTENDERS Two well-known Republicans, Kris Kobach in Kansas and Tim Pawlenty in Minnesota, are vying for the governor&rsquo;s office in their home states. Kobach, a leader in the conservative drive to restrict illegal immigration and pass more restrictive voting laws, is challenging Governor Jeff Colyer for their party&rsquo;s nomination on Tuesday. Polls show Kobach, vice chairman of Trump&rsquo;s commission to investigate voting fraud before it collapsed, and the incumbent governor running head-to-head at the top of a big pack. Pawlenty, a former two-term governor whose 2012 presidential bid ended quickly, is running against a county commissioner to get his old job back in Minnesota&rsquo;s Aug. 14 primary.

(Reuters) - The president of CBS Entertainment said on Sunday that the broadcast network is committed to a safe workplace following a &ldquo;tough week&rdquo; clouded by allegations of sexual misconduct against Chief Executive Leslie Moonves.   CBS Corp (CBS.N ) executive Kelly Kahl was hit with several questions about the accusations against Moonves and the overall culture at CBS Entertainment, the unit that oversees programming for the broadcast unit, during a 25-minute session at a Television Critics Association event where networks promote upcoming shows. &ldquo;Obviously, this has been a tough week at CBS,&rdquo; Kahl said, adding that he struggled with how to express his response to a report in The New Yorker magazine on July 27 that detailed claims by six women who said Moonves sexually harassed them in incidents between 1985 and 2006. &ldquo;Leslie been an excellent boss and a mentor for a long time. He put me in this job,&rdquo; Kahl said. &ldquo;At the same time we must respect the voices that come forward. All allegations need to be and are being taken seriously.&rdquo; Moonves has said that he &ldquo;may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances&rdquo; decades ago, which he called mistakes that he regretted immensely, but that he understood &ldquo;&lsquo;no&rsquo; means &lsquo;no&rsquo;&rdquo; and had never used his position to harm anyone&rsquo;s career. CBS hired two law firms and appointed former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White to lead a probe into the allegations and the broader culture at CBS. It also set up a special board committee, recusing Moonves from the investigation but leaving him in his job as CBS chief. Shares of CBS have fallen 7 percent from their opening price on July 27, closing at $53.16 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. Questions about Moonves and CBS&rsquo; workplace culture dominated Kahl&rsquo;s session and overshadowed the network&rsquo;s effort to promote its lineup for the fall television season. Kahl said CBS was &ldquo;committed to a collaborative, inclusive and safe workplace.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not saying we&rsquo;re perfect, no large company is,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is always room for improvement.&rdquo; Kahl said several female executives approached him after the New Yorker article was published and told him they were &ldquo;dismayed&rdquo; by what they read because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not their experience.&rdquo; &ldquo;All came to me and said they felt, at least CBS Entertainment, is a nurturing, welcoming environment,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Almost all of our department heads are women. They feel supported.&rdquo; "},"d4aa1997ff3826aa48d9813b6b8bec41":{"title":"Israel says Gaza truce talks focus on easing closure in return for calm","text":"JERUSALEM\/GAZA (Reuters) - Israel set out limited goals for Gaza truce talks on Sunday, saying the focus was on a proposal to ease its blockade of the Islamist Hamas-controlled territory in return for the Palestinians calming their side of the frontier. The Israeli statement came hours before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his security cabinet to discuss, and possibly approve U.N.- and Egyptian-brokered ideas for preventing another threatened Gaza war. A very brief statement issued after the meeting ended revealed little. It said that Israel&rsquo;s military chief had briefed the cabinet about the situation in the Gaza Strip and that the army was &ldquo;prepared for any scenario.&rdquo; The United Nations and Egypt have not publicly detailed their proposals. They have spoken generally of a need to improve humanitarian conditions in Gaza, stem cross-border hostilities and reconcile Hamas - which refuses formal peacemaking with Israel - to its Western-backed Palestinian rivals.  Gaza, under years of grinding Israeli and Egyptian sanctions aimed at isolating Hamas, has seen a surge in tensions since Palestinians launched weekly border protests on March 30, drawing Israeli army fire that has killed at least 157 people.  There have also been shelling exchanges between Hamas-led militants and Israel in which around 10 Palestinian gunmen and four civilians have died, Gaza sniper attacks that killed an Israeli soldier and wounded another, and wide-scale brushfires set in Israel by incendiary kites and helium balloons from Gaza.  Israel responded on July 9 by shuttering Gaza&rsquo;s main commercial terminal and limiting a Palestinian fishing zone off the enclave, measures it offered to reverse on Sunday.       &ldquo;A complete ceasefire (by the Palestinians) will lead, on Israel&rsquo;s part, to the reopening of the Kerem Shalom crossing and renewal of the permits given in respect to the fishing zones,&rdquo; said the Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. This offer would be the focus of Sunday&rsquo;s deliberations, the official said, adding that any eventual broader agreement over Gaza would require a guarantee for the return of the remains of two Israeli soldiers killed in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war, and two civilians lost in Gaza. Hamas has linked their fate to Israel freeing Palestinian security detainees - something many Israelis oppose.  Hamas, which convened several of its top leaders to Gaza last week for consultations, also sounded circumspect on Sunday.

REUTERS\/Amir Cohen\/File Photo &ldquo;Hamas has conducted internal meetings that have not yet ended,&rdquo; one senior official, Hussam Badran, told a Gaza radio station. &ldquo;The suffering of our people, and the 12-year blockade imposed with no guilt on their part, requires that all Palestinian leaders search for a real solution to this suffering ... without giving concessions when it comes to the known and outstanding positions and rights of our people.&rdquo; More than two million Palestinians, mostly the stateless descendants of people who were driven out or fled from territory that is now Israel at its founding in 1948, are packed into the narrow strip.  Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, but maintains tight control of its land and sea borders. Egypt also restricts movement in and out of Gaza on its border. Israel, the United States and other Western countries regard Hamas as a terrorist organization. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2008, the last of them in 2014. The Fatah movement of Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas who holds sway in the Israeli-occupied West Bank has denounced the talks. A spokesman said any deal risked ending hopes of achieving Palestinian statehood. &ldquo;(A deal would bring about a) separation of Gaza from the rest of the homeland and would create a mini-state which will be the graveyard of our national project,&rdquo; said Munir Al-Ghaghoub, a spokesman for Abbas&rsquo;s Fatah movement. But after a meeting of Palestinian faction representatives including Fatah, Hamas&rsquo;s Badran said: &ldquo;There will be no state in Gaza and no state without Gaza.&rdquo; In what appeared to be a confidence-building gesture by Cairo, a pro-Hamas website said Egypt was on Sunday beginning to allow cooking gas across its border to Gaza to make up for the shortfall in Israeli supplies.    Also on Sunday, the Israeli military said it fired toward a vehicle used by Palestinian balloon-launchers in Gaza on Sunday. Palestinian medics said four people were wounded. Israel&rsquo;s Defence Ministry released first images of the barrier it has built along the border with the Gaza Strip that stretches into the sea, and which it began constructing two months ago. Built up with rocks and gravel, it stretches 200 meters from the shore into the Mediterranean. It is 50 meters wide and a six-meter high steel fence is placed next to it facing the Gaza side which will have surveillance devices placed on it.

Results easily topped analyst forecasts. Underwriting profit at the Geico auto insurance unit more than quintupled, the BNSF railroad benefited from demand to ship consumer products, grain, petroleum and steel, and the Berkshire Hathaway Automotive car dealership financed more vehicle purchases. &ldquo;Good results across the board,&rdquo; said Doug Kass, who runs the hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management Inc in Palm Beach, Florida. He has previously sold Berkshire shares short, betting on a decline, but is not doing so now. Berkshire also said second-quarter net income nearly tripled, though that reflected a new accounting rule requiring it to report unrealized investment gains with earnings. Buffett says the rule distorts net results and can mislead investors. Operating profit rose to $6.89 billion, or roughly $4,190 per Class A share, from $4.12 billion, or $2,505 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected operating profit of $3,387 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. Net income rose to $12.01 billion, or $7,301 per Class A share, from $4.26 billion, or $2,592 per share, a year earlier. Results also reflected a decline in Berkshire&rsquo;s effective income tax rate to 20 percent from 28.9 percent, following last year&rsquo;s cut in the federal corporate tax rate. Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska, and has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, chemicals, energy, food and retail, industrial parts, railroad and other sectors. Their day-to-day operations are overseen by Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, each seen by investors as a possible successor to Buffett, 87, as chief executive. Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 94, handle major capital allocation decisions. BITING INTO APPLE Book value per Class A share, reflecting assets minus liabilities and a preferred measure of growth for Buffett, rose 3 percent in the quarter to $217,677. Berkshire also ended June with $111.1 billion of cash and equivalents, some of which Buffett could use to repurchase stock under a new policy giving him and Munger more freedom to buy back stock they considered undervalued. The change reflected Buffett&rsquo;s inability to find big acquisitions since January 2016, when Berkshire paid $32.1 billion for aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts. Buffett has not bought back stock in 2018, but has spent money on stocks, and Berkshire said it ended June with a $47.2 billion stake in Apple Inc. Apple&rsquo;s share price at the time suggests that Berkshire may have bought about 15 million Apple shares in the second quarter, on top of 239.6 million it already owned. The iPhone maker this week became the first U.S.-listed company whose stock market value topped $1 trillion. Berkshire spent $6.08 billion on equities in the quarter. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Class A shares of Berkshire closed Friday at $304,671, or 7 percent below their Jan. 29 peak, while Class B shares closed at $200.24, or 8 percent below their peak the same day. GEICO, BNSF Insurance underwriting profit totaled $943 million, compared with a year earlier $22 million loss. Geico&rsquo;s pre-tax underwriting profit rose to $673 million from $119 million, after it boosted rates in response to rising accident and storm losses. Float, or insurance premiums collected before claims are paid and which help fund Berkshire&rsquo;s growth, ended June at $116 billion. BNSF profit surged 37 percent to $1.31 billion, as economic growth led to more shipments of consumer goods, and demand for fertilizer, grain, petroleum products, plastics, sand and steel. Profit from manufacturing, services and retailing units rose 29 percent, reflecting demand at Precision Castparts, Berkshire Hathaway Automotive and the German motorcycle accessories unit Detlev Louis Motorrad.

Washington is expected to soon implement tariffs on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods, which China has already said it will match immediately. &ldquo;The White House&rsquo;s extreme pressure and blackmail are already clear to the international community,&rdquo; said a state television commentary. &ldquo;Such methods of extreme blackmail will not bear fruit against China.&rdquo; TRUMP TOUTS TARIFFS, SAYS THEY ARE WORKING In a series of tweets on Saturday, Trump disagreed. &ldquo;Tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated,&rdquo; he claimed, citing a big drop in China&rsquo;s stock market. &ldquo;They are really hurting their economy.&rdquo; Trump also claimed that China was talking to the United States about trade, but he provided no details. He said his administration would continue to employ tariffs if other nations were unwilling to come to the table on trade. &ldquo;We are using them to negotiate fair trade deals,&rdquo; Trump said. China has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on $110 billion in U.S. goods, representing the vast majority of China&rsquo;s annual imports of American products. Last year, China imported about $130 billion in goods from the United States. Trump has ultimately threatened tariffs on over $500 billion in Chinese goods, covering virtually all U.S. imports from China. &ldquo;The U.S. has repeatedly resorted to threatening and deceitful routines, trying to force China to compromise, both overestimating its own bargaining power and underestimating China&rsquo;s determination and ability to defend its national dignity and the interests of its people,&rdquo; said a commentary in the official Xinhua news agency. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, remained staunch on Washington&rsquo;s push for fairer trading conditions with China.  &ldquo;President Trump inherited an unfair trade regime where American workers and American companies were not treated reciprocally or fairly by the Chinese, and the efforts of the Trump administration are to right that, to correct that,&rdquo; Pompeo told reporters on the sidelines of a regional forum in Singapore.  Pompeo added that he had discussed trade issues with Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi on Friday. Wang said on Friday they did not get into details. Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah said he met Pompeo in Singapore and that his message was clear. &ldquo;My objective was quite straightforward: I think I need to inform him that we are very concerned,&rdquo; said Saifuddin. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Countries like Malaysia form an integral part of Chinese exporters&rsquo; supply chains, and analysts have warned a trade war could knock billions of dollars off their economic growth in coming years.

The planned combination in an all-shares merger, agreed in principle in December 2016, would create a global leader in gas distribution ahead of France&rsquo;s Air Liquide (AIRP.PA ). But the companies agreed at the time that if regulators demanded the disposal of businesses with more than $3.7 billion in sales or $1.1 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), either party could withdraw without penalty. Linde said on Sunday it was informed that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had &ldquo;expressed expectations with regards to further divestiture commitments and prospective purchasers which are considered required for a merger clearance,&rdquo; it said. Based on its discussions with the FTC and other antitrust regulators, it said there was now a higher probability that the two companies would need to commit to selling assets exceeding the agreed threshold. The two companies are now evaluating how the regulators&rsquo; expectations could be fulfilled in a mutually acceptable manner to achieve a timely clearance of the planned merger, it said, adding they remained in a constructive dialogue with the regulators and with each other. Reuters reported last month that the European Commission was set to give its blessing to the tie-up after an in-depth antitrust review and following the agreed sale of Praxair&rsquo;s European gases business to Japanese rival Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp (4091.T ). In addition, Linde agreed to sell North and South American assets to a consortium of German gases firm Messer and buyout group CVC in a deal that will raise around $3.3 billion.

Talks to modernize the 1994 trade pact started in August 2017 but have dragged on much longer than expected as Canada and Mexico pushed back against far-reaching U.S. demands for reform. President Donald Trump has said he will walk away from NAFTA unless major changes are made. In a renewed push, Mexican and U.S. cabinet ministers held a series of meetings in Washington over the past week in a bid to work out their differences. One Mexican official expressed optimism that some kind of agreement could be reached by the end of the month. &ldquo;I and Canada are very, very keen to get it done as quickly as possible,&rdquo; Freeland told reporters on a conference call. She did not answer directly when asked whether the end of August was a realistic deadline.

Freeland said she was ready to join the talks at any time but did not give details. Canadian officials dismiss speculation that she is being sidelined. &ldquo;While this is a trilateral agreement ... there are also significant bilateral trading issues between each of the countries,&rdquo; said Freeland, adding that she welcomed bilateral talks between Canada&rsquo;s two NAFTA partners.

With less than eight months until Britain quits the EU, the government has yet to agree a divorce deal with Brussels and has stepped up planning for the possibility of leaving the bloc without any formal agreement. Fox, a prominent Brexit supporter in Prime Minister Theresa May&rsquo;s cabinet, put the odds of Britain leaving the European Union without agreeing a deal over their future relationship at 60-40. &ldquo;I think the intransigence of the commission is pushing us toward no deal,&rdquo; Fox told the Sunday Times after a trade mission in Japan. &ldquo;We have set out the basis in which a deal can happen but if the EU decides that the theological obsession of the unelected is to take priority over the economic wellbeing of the people of Europe then it&rsquo;s a bureaucrats&rsquo; Brexit \u2014 not a people&rsquo;s Brexit \u2014 (and) then there is only going to be one outcome.&rdquo; It was up to the EU whether it wanted to put &ldquo;ideological purity&rdquo; ahead of the real economy, Fox said. If Britain fails to agree the terms of its divorce with the EU and leaves without even a transition agreement to smooth its exit, it would revert to trading under World Trade Organization rules in March 2019.  Most economists think this would cause serious harm to the world&rsquo;s No.5 economy as trade with the EU, Britain&rsquo;s largest market, would become subject to tariffs. Supporters of Brexit say there may be some short-term pain for Britain&rsquo;s $2.9 trillion economy, but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU, which some of them cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. On Friday Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the chances of a no-deal Brexit had become &ldquo;uncomfortably high&rdquo;.

The suspects launched two drones laden with explosives over an outdoor rally Maduro was holding in downtown Caracas to commemorate the National Guard, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said. One was &ldquo;diverted&rdquo; by security forces while the second fell on its own and hit an apartment building, Reverol said. The attack highlights Maduro&rsquo;s challenges in maintaining control over the OPEC nation, where widespread food and medicine shortages have fueled outrage and despair everywhere from hillside slums to military barracks.  &ldquo;These terrorist acts represent a slap in the face to the expressed desire of the President of the Republic, Nicolas Maduro, for national reconciliation and dialogue,&rdquo; Reverol said in a statement read on state television. State television footage of the rally showed Maduro startled by what appeared to be an explosion and footage later panned to soldiers lined up on a boulevard who chaotically broke ranks in what appeared to be a reaction to a second blast. The president later described the attack, which injured seven soldiers, as an assassination attempt. One of the suspects had an outstanding arrest warrant for involvement in a 2017 attack on a military base that killed two people, Reverol said, an incident that followed four months of anti-government protests. A second suspect had been detained during a wave of anti-Maduro protests in 2014 but had been released through &ldquo;procedural benefits,&rdquo; Reverol said, without offering details. Related CoverageApparent attack in Venezuela highlights risk of drone strikes He did not name the suspects. The arrests suggest the attack was less a military uprising than an assault led by groups linked to anti-Maduro street protesters, dubbed &ldquo;The Resistance,&rdquo; who have led two waves of violent demonstrations that left hundreds dead.  That is consistent with the shadowy group that claimed responsibility for the attack, The National Movement of Soldiers in T-Shirts, whose website says it was created in 2014 to bring together different groups of protesters.  Reuters was unable to independently confirm the involvement of the group, which did not respond to requests for comment on the arrest announcements, or identify any of its members. &lsquo;I SAW THE LITTLE PLANE&rsquo;  Bolivar Avenue of downtown Caracas, where the incident took place, was calm on Sunday. Joggers and cyclists were taking up two of the lanes that are traditionally used for weekend recreation. The stage where Maduro spoke had been removed.  Witnesses said they heard and felt an explosion in the late afternoon, then saw a drone fall out of the sky and hit a nearby building. &ldquo;I heard the first explosion, it was so strong that the buildings moved,&rdquo; said Mairum Gonzalez, 45, a pre-school teacher. &ldquo;I went to the balcony and I saw the little plane ... it hit the building and smoke started to come out.&rdquo; Two witnesses said they later saw security forces halt a black Chevrolet and arrest three men inside it.  The security forces later took apart the car and found what appeared to be remote controls, tablets and computers, said the two, who identified themselves as Andres and Karina, without giving their last names.  Opposition critics accuse Maduro of fabricating or exaggerating security incidents to distract from hyperinflation and Soviet-style product shortages.  Leopoldo Lopez, formerly mayor of Caracas&rsquo; district of Chacao, for example, is under house arrest for his role in 2014 street protests that Maduro described as a coup attempt but his adversaries insisted were a form of free expression. &ldquo;We warn that the government is taking advantage of this incident ... to criminalize those who legitimately and democratically oppose it and deepen the repression and systematic human rights violations,&rdquo; wrote the Broad Front opposition coalition in a statement published on Twitter. Maduro&rsquo;s allies counter that the opposition has a history of involvement in military conspiracies, most notably in the 2002 coup that briefly toppled socialist leader Hugo Chavez.  &ldquo;I have no doubt that everything points to the right, the Venezuelan ultra-right,&rdquo; Maduro said on Saturday night. &ldquo;Maximum punishment! And there will be no forgiveness.&rdquo;  Maduro, who blames the country&rsquo;s problems on an &ldquo;economic war&rdquo; led by adversaries, during the course of his five-year rule has often announced having foiled military plots against him that he says are backed by Washington. U.S. national security adviser John Bolton told Fox News in an interview on Sunday that the United States was not involved in the blast.

The fact that the British misgivings stem in part from Huawei&rsquo;s relationship with a U.S. company shows how trade wars and heightened national security concerns are making it harder for technology firms and governments to safeguard products and communication networks.  A report last month by a British government oversight board charged with analyzing Huawei equipment said it had found technical and supply chain &ldquo;shortcomings&rdquo; which exposed the country&rsquo;s telecoms networks to new security risks. One of those is due to Huawei&rsquo;s use of the VxWorks operating system, which is made by California-based Wind River Systems, said three people with knowledge of the matter, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity when discussing details which were not made public in the report.  The sources said the version of VxWorks being used by Huawei will stop receiving security patches and updates from Wind River in 2020, even though some of the products it is embedded in will still be in service, potentially leaving British telecoms networks vulnerable to attack. &ldquo;Third party software, including security critical components, on various component boards will come out of existing long-term support in 2020, even though the Huawei end of life date for the products containing this component is often longer,&rdquo; the July report, which did not name VxWorks, said. U.S. and Australian lawmakers have said Huawei&rsquo;s products can be used to facilitate Chinese espionage operations, an allegation the world&rsquo;s biggest producer of telecoms equipment has repeatedly denied. FILE PHOTO: The logo of the Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. is seen outside its headquarters in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, April 17, 2012.  REUTERS\/Tyrone Siu\/File Photo All three sources said there was no indication that the VxWorks mismatch was deliberate. There is also no suggestion that the software itself represents a security risk.  Reuters was not able to establish which Huawei products were involved or what steps the Chinese company was taking to address the issue. A spokeswoman for Wind River Systems said she was unable to comment on Huawei, but said the company often helped customers upgrade to newer software versions. &ldquo;Wind River offers migration routes and paths for its customers, which should be pretty well known and understood in the industry,&rdquo; she said. A Huawei spokesman declined to comment on specific issues in the report but said the company would address any areas for improvement which were raised by British authorities. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &ldquo;Cyber security remains Huawei&rsquo;s top priority, and we will continue to actively improve our engineering processes and risk management systems,&rdquo; he said. LEGITIMATE CONCERN While the United States and Australia have moved to restrict the use of its gear due to security concerns, Huawei has been deepening ties with Britain, supplying broadband equipment to its largest telecoms provider, BT Group (BT.L ), and mobile networks for wireless giant Vodafone Group (VOD.L ).     Consultant Edward Amoroso, a former chief security officer at AT&T, said Huawei&rsquo;s experience in Britain showed the challenges of securing international supply chains.  Although no one should dismiss Huawei as a supplier solely because of its geographical location, reliance on software that is going out of support is a legitimate concern, Amoroso said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s from China, Indiana or the moon, it speaks badly for them,&rdquo; he added. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The globalized nature of the technology industry has come under increasing scrutiny as countries seek to limit the use of equipment from nations they regard as adversaries. In the United States, the Pentagon is working on a &ldquo;do not buy&rdquo; list to block vendors who use software code originating from Russia and China, and Moscow has had problems implementing a data storage law without relying on foreign technology. By contrast, London says it effectively addresses any security issues presented by the use of Huawei products as part of Britain&rsquo;s critical national infrastructure by having the equipment reviewed by staff at a special company laboratory. This is overseen by British government and intelligence officials who report annually on its work. In addition to the issue with VxWorks, this year&rsquo;s report also cited technical issues which limited security researchers&rsquo; ability to check internal product code.   Many in the cybersecurity industry say efforts to bar equipment or software on grounds of nationality are futile because of the deeply inter-dependent nature of the global technology business.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a real dilemma for policy makers, for politicians,&rdquo; said Robert Hannigan, former director of Britain&rsquo;s GCHQ spy agency and now executive chairman for Europe at cybersecurity services firm BlueVoyant. &ldquo;How do we find a way of taking advantage of foreign technology in a way that we don&rsquo;t think compromises our security? That&rsquo;s a really difficult balance to get.&rdquo; "},"de5d1026fa9cd17e8dbc219d85f4b471":{"title":"TSMC says third-quarter revenue hit by computer virus","text":"TAIPEI (Reuters) - A computer virus outbreak has hit third-quarter results at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd, the world&rsquo;s largest contract chipmaker, the company said on Sunday.

After becoming the first $1 trillion publicly-listed U.S. company on Thursday, Apple last traded up 0.1 pct at $207.57 after falling as low as $205.48 and as high as $208.74, as it oscillated around the $207.0425 price that marked the record market cap. Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust in Atlanta, said Apple&rsquo;s lukewarm Friday was a temporary pause for the stock rather than a sign it could lose ground.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like the horse that crosses the finish line and says I&rsquo;m totally wiped out,&rdquo; said Morgan, whose firm holds more than 200,000 shares in Apple.  &ldquo;There was a strong earnings report on Tuesday.

U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington, D.C., said he would stay Friday&rsquo;s order, however, until August 23 to give the administration time to decide whether to appeal.  Bates first issued a ruling in April ordering the federal government to continue the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, including taking applications. He stayed that ruling for 90 days to give the government time to better explain why the program should be ended.  On Friday Bates, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, a Republican, said he would not revise his previous ruling because the arguments of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration did not override his concerns. Under DACA, roughly 700,000 young adults, often referred to as &ldquo;Dreamers&rdquo;, were protected from deportation and given work permits for two-year periods, after which they must re-apply to the program.  The program was created in 2012 under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.  Two other federal courts in California and New York had previously ordered that DACA remain in place while litigation challenging Trump&rsquo;s decision to end it continued. Those rulings only required the government to process DACA renewals, not new applications.  Another lawsuit in a Texas federal court is seeking to end DACA. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday that the government would continue to defend its position that it &ldquo;acted within its lawful authority in deciding to wind down DACA in an orderly manner.&rdquo; Congress so far has failed to pass legislation to address the fate of the Dreamers, including a potential path to citizenship. Friday&rsquo;s ruling came in lawsuits filed by several groups and institutions, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Princeton University.

(Reuters) - An accountant for U.S. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s one-time campaign chairman Paul Manafort admitted in trial testimony on Friday that she helped backdate documents and falsify financial records at Manafort and his business partner&rsquo;s request to reduce his tax burden and help him qualify for loans. Cynthia Laporta, who prepared Manafort&rsquo;s tax returns starting in 2014, told a jury in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, that she was testifying under an immunity agreement with the government to avoid being prosecuted as Manafort was charged with bank fraud and tax fraud. One member of the jury nodded in apparent agreement when U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis cut off the prosecution&rsquo;s questioning to ask her if she was afraid of being prosecuted herself. &ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; answered Laporta, explaining that she went along with accounting maneuvers suggested by Manafort and his longtime business associate Rick Gates because she did not want to create problems for her firm or lose a top client. &ldquo;I very much regret it,&rdquo; Laporta said on the trial&rsquo;s fourth day as prosecutors build their case that Manafort hid tens of millions of dollars he earned working for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine to evade taxes. Laporta, the 14th witness to testify for the prosecution, was the most damaging yet for Manafort in the first trial arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.  Manafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts, charges that largely pre-date the five months Manafort worked for Trump, some of them as campaign chairman. Related CoverageManafort accountant tells court tax treatment of loan was wrong Manafort accountant, at trial, says money transfers raised concerns Once the jury had been dismissed for the day, Ellis gave defense lawyers a green light for detailed cross examination of Laporta on Monday. &ldquo;You are not limited in your cross examination of her,&rdquo; Ellis said. Both Laporta and fellow accountant Philip Ayliff, her predecessor who handled Manafort&rsquo;s tax filings at the firm KWC, testified that they had no knowledge that Manafort controlled foreign bank accounts. The government has provided trial evidence of Manafort controlling a web of overseas accounts in Cyprus and elsewhere. Such accounts must be reported to tax authorities if they contain $10,000 or more. Laporta also detailed multiple examples in which Manafort and Gates sought to doctor financial records. One instance involved classifying revenue from a Cyprus-based company as a loan to lower his taxable income, Laporta testified. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard-hitting testimony that creates an uphill battle for the defense, but that&rsquo;s what cross examination is for,&rdquo; said Andrew Boutros, a former federal prosecutor who is now a white collar defense lawyer. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if there is enough to convict him right now, but they&rsquo;re laying the groundwork for it.&rdquo; A conviction would give momentum to Mueller&rsquo;s probe, in which 32 people and three companies have been indicted or pleaded guilty. Trump, angered by any questions about the legitimacy of his election win, has called Mueller&rsquo;s investigation a witch hunt and wants it to be shut down. TARGETING GATES After spending the first two days of the trial laying out Manafort&rsquo;s lavish spending, the prosecution is now digging into how he accounted for the more than $60 million he made in Ukraine and his efforts to allegedly mislead banks to get loans once the income from Ukraine dropped off precipitously in 2014. Manafort&rsquo;s attorneys have signaled they will seek to blame Gates, who was Trump&rsquo;s deputy campaign chairman in 2016. Gates pleaded guilty in February and is expected to testify against Manafort, possibly next week. Prosecutor Uzo Asonye focused some of his questioning on money transfers from a Cyprus-based company called Telmar Investments Ltd, which records showed had paid Manafort&rsquo;s firm more than $5 million for consulting work.  That income posed a problem for Manafort when it came time to prepare his business tax returns in September 2015, Laporta testified. She said Gates told her in a conference call the income level &ldquo;was too high&rdquo; and proposed reclassifying a portion of it as a loan.  Laporta said she knew it was &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; but agreed to alter the records to show that Manafort&rsquo;s firm received a $900,000 loan from Telmar in 2014, a change that would save Manafort nearly a half million dollars in taxes, Laporta said. Manafort signed an agreement to account for that loan that was backdated, according to Laporta and an exhibit shown to the jury. Trial consultant Roy Futterman, who is following the trial but not involved in it, said, &ldquo;The prosecution is doing a very good job of keeping a brisk pace, putting witnesses on for short direct examinations, keeping it lively and keeping very tight messages for each witness.&rdquo; Manafort&rsquo;s attorneys do not seem to have scored a lot of points on cross-examination, Futterman said, but added that the witnesses who have testified so far are not &ldquo;the main targets.&rdquo; Earlier on Friday prosecutors asked Ayliff about Manafort&rsquo;s accounting of a $1.5 million transfer in 2012 from Peranova Holdings Ltd as a loan, even as records showed that no interest or principal was paid on it in subsequent years. Peranova is one of numerous Cypriot entities that prosecutors have said Manafort controlled. Ayliff testified that KWC did not know Manafort controlled Peranova, and that if the transfer was a payment related to his consulting work in Ukraine it would have been treated as income - not as a loan - on his tax returns.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said in an order on Friday that the government would be allowed to release transcripts of the conversations that generally occurred between Judge Richard Leon, who tried the case, and one or more lawyers from the Justice Department, AT&T and Time Warner.  A loud hissing noise was played over the public address system in the court during the conferences to ensure that reporters and others in the courtroom could not hear what was said. Judge Leon ruled in June that the Justice Department was wrong to ask that a $85.4 billion merger of AT&T, which owns DirecTV, and Time Warner be blocked. The government had said it would lead to higher prices for consumers and was illegal under antitrust law. The Justice Department has appealed but no date has been set  for when the appeals court will hear the case. The deal closed on June 14.  AT&T has said it would manage Time Warner&rsquo;s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government&rsquo;s appeal. The merger, announced in October 2016, was opposed by President Donald Trump.

The world&rsquo;s No. 2 brewer will take a 40 percent holding in CRH Beer, giving it a strong distribution network in China and greater access to a market it has so far found tough to crack. For CR Beer, the maker of the locally popular Snow beer, the deal is a way to get into the foreign-dominated premium sector at a time when Chinese demand for lower-end brands is waning. &ldquo;This (deal) will help accelerate CR Beer&rsquo;s Snow beer high-end strategy and achieve its goal to take a leading position in the premium market within 5-10 years,&rdquo; CR Beer&rsquo;s Chief Executive Hou Xiaohai told reporters on a call on Friday. Snow accounts for about 90 percent of CR Beer&rsquo;s total beer sales volumes but is almost exclusively sold in China. CR Beer hopes to use Heineken&rsquo;s global network to market it abroad.  CR Beer shares initially jumped as much as 10 percent but closed down 0.99 percent, while Heineken&rsquo;s rose 2 percent. &ldquo;Thanks to the strong position of CR Beer and understanding of the market growth of the Heineken brand should improve in the coming years,&rdquo; analysts at Degroof Petercam wrote in a note.     NOT GOING IT ALONE Heineken had struggled to compete with the dominant players in China&rsquo;s premium lager market such as Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR ) and Carlsberg (CARLb.CO ) on a national scale.  The Dutch group had a 0.5 percent share of the China market by volume in 2017, data from research firm Euromonitor International showed, while AB Inbev had 16.1 percent. CR Beer had more than a quarter share.  Heineken chief executive Jean-Francois van Boxmeer said the company would have found it hard to replicate good results it had achieved in provinces such as Fujian throughout China. &ldquo;(It) is something that would have cost way too much money and we have no time for that,&rdquo; van Boxmeer said on a conference call following the announcement of the deal with CRH Beer. Slideshow (3 Images)  Heineken will inject its three breweries in China into CR Beer and license its Heineken brand in China, Hong Kong and Macau to CR Beer. China Resources Enterprise will own the remaining 60 percent of CRH Beer and will also buy 5.2 million Heineken shares for 464 million euros ($538 million).  The combined transactions would result in a net investment of 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion) by Heineken, the two firms said in a joint statement. DISTRIBUTION, EXPANSION PLANS Heineken sells its premium lagers Heineken, Tiger and Sol in China, along with cheaper local brands Anchor and Hainan Beer. CR Beer&rsquo;s Hou said the company would use its extensive local distribution network to promote Heineken&rsquo;s brands and was contemplating bringing in other Heineken-owned brands not yet in China, though that was still under discussion.  Heineken, which noted the deal should boost its profit margins, said it would assist CR Beer to monitor the quality of its Heineken products, marketing efforts and pricing but would otherwise stand back. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re great professionals, we wouldn&rsquo;t want to second guess what they are doing at the steering wheel in China,&rdquo; van Boxmeer said, adding it was up to the Chinese group to decide on the future of the Dutch company&rsquo;s local brands. The deal would not impact Heineken&rsquo;s sponsorship of the Chinese Formula 1 Grand Prix, which was part of a global sponsorship arrangement, van Boxmeer added. The Chinese brewer also hopes to eventually expand Snow beer  into overseas markets such as Southeast Asia, Europe, the United States and Australia through Heineken&rsquo;s network, he said.   The companies are conducting due diligence and will need anti-trust approval from China, a person with direct knowledge said, adding the deal is expected to be completed by year-end. JP Morgan is advising Heineken, while China Resources has enlisted Nomura and UBS as advisers. The banks did not immediately comment. Reuters reported in March that China Resources Beer was in talks to acquire Heineken&rsquo;s China business.

It could become more difficult for supervisors to demand more capital for certain risks. Supervisors&rsquo; instruments would be weakened,&rdquo; Lautenschlaeger said, without being more specific. Commenting on ECB monetary policy, she said that it would be wrong for the central bank to abruptly change direction. &ldquo;That would help neither the economy nor price stability ...

The Cayman Islands-flagged Equanimity was seized in February at the request of U.S. authorities as part of a multi-billion dollar corruption investigation launched by the Department of Justice (DOJ) related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). An Indonesian court ruling in April declared that the yacht was wrongfully impounded and should be released to its owners, but Indonesian police seized the boat again in July following a formal request for legal assistance from the United States. Indonesian police said they would hand the yacht over to Malaysia but did not specify when. &ldquo;The yacht will be handed over\u00a0at the border between Indonesia and Malaysia&rsquo;s waters,&rdquo; Daniel Silitonga, deputy director for economic and special crimes at the Indonesian national police force&rsquo;s Criminal Investigation Agency, told Reuters by text message.  &ldquo;We have to maintain the good relations between the two countries,&rdquo; he said, adding that the yacht is currently in waters close\u00a0to the border of Singapore and the Indonesian island of Batam. A spokesman for Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad&rsquo;s office said &ldquo;some arrangements&rdquo; were being made with Indonesian authorities regarding the yacht and that an announcement would be made when the details were finalised. A source familiar with the negotiations told Reuters on Friday that Indonesia had agreed to hand the yacht to Malaysia following a personal request by Mahathir. Mahathir, who previously served as prime minister from 1981-2003 and is now 93, visited Indonesia in June on his first official visit in the region since returning to power in May in a surprise election win over Najib Razak. 1MDB, founded by Najib, is at the center of money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. A total of $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates, according to U.S. civil lawsuits filed by the DOJ. Najib has denied wrongdoing. Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho is described in the lawsuits as a central figure in the scandal. The DOJ says Low used proceeds diverted from 1MDB to procure Equanimity, a 300-ft (91-m) yacht registered in the Cayman Islands.  The $250 million vessel is said to have an interior clad in marble and gold leaf, a spa and sauna, a 20-meter swimming pool on deck, a movie theater, a lift and a helipad. In an emailed statement, a spokesman for Low&rsquo;s legal team said the handing over of Equanimity to Malaysia was illegal and that it was politically motivated. Malaysian authorities are seeking to arrest Low, whose whereabouts are unknown. His Malaysian passport was revoked and an arrest warrant has been issued against him. Low has previously denied any wrongdoing.

Pompeo was asked in a briefing to reporters traveling back with him to Washington whether he was concerned by Ri&rsquo;s remarks.

The People&rsquo;s Bank of China late on Friday raised the reserve requirement on foreign exchange forward positions, making it more expensive to bet against the Chinese currency. The move boosted the Australian dollar, which is often played as a liquid proxy for the yuan. The Aussie came off two-week lows to climb as high as $0.7412 after the announcement, and was last at $0.7396.  Analysts say the step by the PBOC will be generally positive for Asian assets.    &ldquo;Leaning against bearish CNY sentiment is important because a rapidly weakening currency risks triggering residential outflows and destabilizing domestic asset prices,&rdquo; JPMorgan analysts said in a note. &ldquo;Our economists think that PBOC likely will take further action if CNY depreciation continues or capital outflow pressure increases.&rdquo;  On Monday, MSCI&rsquo;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.2 percent for a second straight session of gains.  Japan&rsquo;s Nikkei edged up 0.1 percent, while Australian shares added 0.5 percent. South Korea&rsquo;s KOSPI index rose 0.4 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow climbed 0.54 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.46 percent and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.12 percent. They were helped by strong corporate earnings, although gains were capped by worries over the escalating trade tensions. China&rsquo;s finance ministry proposed tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods on Friday, while a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks with Washington to resolve the bitter trade conflict. That was followed by a report in China&rsquo;s state media saying Friday&rsquo;s retaliatory tariffs were &ldquo;rational&rdquo; while accusing the United States of blackmail. At the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump said his strategy of placing steep tariffs on Chinese imports is &ldquo;working far better than anyone ever anticipated&rdquo;, citing losses in China&rsquo;s stock market. He predicted the U.S. market could &ldquo;go up dramatically&rdquo; once trade deals were renegotiated. &ldquo;Our economists consider that escalation in tension may bring the U.S. and China back to the negotiation table, but that even if negotiations are resumed, a bumpy and lengthy process is likely to ensue as the two sides remain very far apart,&rdquo; JPMorgan added. According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year. In currencies, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1 percent at 95.259. Traders see further upside in the dollar as they maintained a significantly large long position on the currency, while net short bets on the Aussie were their largest since November 2015. The British pound held at $1.30 after falling to an 11-day low of $1.2975 following remarks by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney that Britain faced an &ldquo;uncomfortably high&rdquo; risk of a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit.

The People&rsquo;s Bank of China late on Friday raised the reserve requirement on foreign exchange forward positions, making it more expensive to bet against the Chinese currency. The move boosted the Australian dollar, which is often played as a liquid proxy for the yuan. The Aussie came off two-week lows to climb as high as $0.7412 after the announcement, and was last at $0.7396.  Analysts say the step by the PBOC will be generally positive for Asian assets.    &ldquo;Leaning against bearish CNY sentiment is important because a rapidly weakening currency risks triggering residential outflows and destabilizing domestic asset prices,&rdquo; JPMorgan analysts said in a note. &ldquo;Our economists think that PBOC likely will take further action if CNY depreciation continues or capital outflow pressure increases.&rdquo;  On Monday, MSCI&rsquo;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.2 percent for a second straight session of gains.  Japan&rsquo;s Nikkei edged up 0.1 percent, while Australian shares added 0.5 percent. South Korea&rsquo;s KOSPI index rose 0.4 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow climbed 0.54 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.46 percent and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.12 percent. They were helped by strong corporate earnings, although gains were capped by worries over the escalating trade tensions. China&rsquo;s finance ministry proposed tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods on Friday, while a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks with Washington to resolve the bitter trade conflict. That was followed by a report in China&rsquo;s state media saying Friday&rsquo;s retaliatory tariffs were &ldquo;rational&rdquo; while accusing the United States of blackmail. At the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump said his strategy of placing steep tariffs on Chinese imports is &ldquo;working far better than anyone ever anticipated&rdquo;, citing losses in China&rsquo;s stock market. He predicted the U.S. market could &ldquo;go up dramatically&rdquo; once trade deals were renegotiated. &ldquo;Our economists consider that escalation in tension may bring the U.S. and China back to the negotiation table, but that even if negotiations are resumed, a bumpy and lengthy process is likely to ensue as the two sides remain very far apart,&rdquo; JPMorgan added. According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year. In currencies, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was up 0.1 percent at 95.259. Traders see further upside in the dollar as they maintained a significantly large long position on the currency, while net short bets on the Aussie were their largest since November 2015. The British pound held at $1.30 after falling to an 11-day low of $1.2975 following remarks by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney that Britain faced an &ldquo;uncomfortably high&rdquo; risk of a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit. The euro inched down to more than 5-week lows of $1.1573.  Gold bounced from near 17-month lows after weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data, and was last up 0.1 percent at $1,213.70.

"},"658c8bb2b23c2fd8e58e25189cb716b6":{"title":"Oil prices rise after Saudi output dips, U.S. drilling stalls","text":"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday after Saudi crude production registered a surprising dip in July and as American shale drilling appeared to plateau. Markets also anticipated an announcement from Washington due later on Monday detailing renewed U.S. sanctions against major oil exporter Iran, set to be reinstated at 1201 EDT on Tuesday (1601 GMT), according to a U.S. Treasury official. Spot Brent crude oil futures were trading at $73.68 per barrel at 0205 GMT on Monday, up 47 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 37 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $68.86 barrel. U.S. energy companies last week cut oil rigs for a second time in the past three weeks as the rate of growth has slowed over the past couple of months. Drillers cut two oil rigs in the week to Aug. 3, bringing the total count down to 859, Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. Many U.S. shale oil drillers posted disappointing quarterly results in recent weeks, hit by rising operating costs, hedging losses and a fall in crude prices away from 2018 highs reached between May and July. Outside the United States, top crude exporter Saudi Arabia pumped around 10.29 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July, two OPEC sources said on Friday, down about 200,000 bpd from a month earlier.  That drop came despite a pledge by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Saudi Arabia is the de-facto leader, in June to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia pledging a &ldquo;measurable&rdquo; supply boost. Still, with Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia now all producing 10 million to 11 million bpd of crude, just three countries now meet around a third of global oil demand.

Fortescue had built up a 19.9 percent interest in Atlas in June, giving it a large enough hold to block a takeover by then suitor Mineral Resources Ltd (MIN.AX ). However, Atlas endorsed a A$390 million ($288.6 million) offer from billionaire Gina Rinehart&rsquo;s Hancock Prospecting later that month. Fortescue eyes more access to capacity at Port Headland in Pilbara, keeping the proposed ramp up of its Eliwana project in focus, a brokerage said in June when Fortescue had initially built up its stake in Atlas. Hancock and Fortescue covet Atlas&rsquo; rights at Australia&rsquo;s biggest iron ore port, Port Hedland, given limited opportunities for expansion. However, Atlas said later the government had notified it that its North West Infrastructure joint venture does not have priority rights to develop shipping berths including ones at Port Headland.        &ldquo;Fortescue will actively participate in the proposed industry consultation with the Western Australian State Government regarding berth access at Port Hedland,&rdquo; said Chief Executive Elizabeth Gaines on Monday. Shares of Atlas rose 1.2 percent while Fortescue moved 1.1  higher with the Australian benchmark  rising 0.7 percent.

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said the death toll was expected to rise with initial reports of hundreds injured and thousands of buildings collapsed or badly damaged. Power and communications were cut in some areas of Lombok, and the military said it was sending in a vessel with medical aid, supplies and logistical support for the island. Lombok was hit a week earlier, on July 29, by a 6.4 magnitude quake that killed 17 people, injured hundreds and briefly stranded several trekkers on the slopes of a volcano.  The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) said that more than 120 aftershocks were recorded after Sunday evening&rsquo;s quake, whose magnitude the U.S. Geological Survey revised down to 6.9 from an original 7.0.  The tremor was so powerful it was felt on the neighboring island of Bali where, according to BNPB, two people died. &ldquo;I was at the rooftop of my hotel and the building started swaying very hard. It felt like two meters to the left, then two meters to the right, I could not stand up,&rdquo; said Gino Poggiali, a 43-year-old Frenchman, who was with his wife and two children. His wife Maude, 44, said the family were on Bali for the first quake and Lombok for the second. &ldquo;This is it for me in Indonesia,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Next time we will stay in France or somewhere close.&rdquo; Long lines formed at the airport of Lombok&rsquo;s main town, Mataram, as foreign visitors cut their holidays short.

The latest criticism from the overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party&rsquo;s People&rsquo;s Daily newspaper singled out Trump, saying he was starring in his own &ldquo;street fighter-style deceitful drama of extortion and intimidation&rdquo;.

REUTERS\/Brian Snyder\/File Photo Trump&rsquo;s desire for others to play along with his drama is &ldquo;wishful thinking&rdquo;, a commentary on the paper&rsquo;s front page said, arguing that the United States had escalated trade friction with China and turned international trade into a &ldquo;zero-sum game&rdquo;. &ldquo;Governing a country is not like doing business,&rdquo; the paper said, adding that Trump&rsquo;s actions imperiled the national credibility of the United States. The United States and China implemented tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other&rsquo;s goods in July. Washington is expected to soon implement tariffs on an additional $16 billion of Chinese goods, which China has already said it will match immediately. On Friday, China&rsquo;s finance ministry unveiled new sets of additional tariffs on 5,207 goods imported from the United States worth $60 billion. That move was in response to the Trump administration&rsquo;s proposal of a 25-percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.

Two people died on the neighboring island of Bali, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said. He said the death toll was expected to rise further as more data became available. &ldquo;Data collection continues and (rescue) efforts are still ongoing,&rdquo; Nugroho told a news conference, adding that there were no foreigners among the victims so far.

Ardern entered the Cabinet&rsquo;s dedicated meeting room on the top storey of the Executive Wing of the country&rsquo;s Parliament building, known as the &lsquo;Beehive&rsquo;, to applause from her ministers.  Taking her place next to Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, she offered her &ldquo;sincere thanks&rdquo; to him for running the country, allowing her to become the first premier in the country&rsquo;s history to take maternity leave while in office.

Shall we get on with it?&rdquo; she said. The 38-year-old premier&rsquo;s pregnancy was seen by many as a symbol of progress for women in leadership roles as she became only the second elected leader, after Pakistan&rsquo;s Benazir Bhutto in 1990, to give birth in office. Ardern officially returned to work on Thursday from her home in Auckland and flew to the capital Wellington on Saturday where she was welcomed at the airport by singing from a high school choir. She held a short media briefing there with her daughter, Neve Te Aroha, asleep in her arms.

It is the latest in a series of high-tech initiatives in the city-state, some of which have stoked privacy concerns among rights advocates, aimed at improving efficiency and security as the threat of militancy in the region has ratcheted up. Iris-scanning technology, which has been used in other countries like the United States and the United Kingdom with varying degrees of success, can cost five times more than existing fingerprint systems, according to experts. &ldquo;The trials will help us in our consideration of whether and how we should implement such technology at our checkpoints,&rdquo; an Immigration Checkpoint Authority (ICA) spokesman was quoted as saying by the Straits Times newspaper. The move will be implemented at two checkpoints on its northern border with Malaysia and one at a ferry terminal running services to nearby Indonesian islands, the Straits Times reported. The trials will only affect Singapore citizens and permanent residents, the Straits Times said, and the ICA has been collecting iris images since January last year when people apply for identity cards or a passport. When contacted by Reuters, the ICA confirmed the accuracy of the report but did not comment immediately on further details of the scheme. Singapore&rsquo;s highly acclaimed Changi Airport is considering using facial recognition systems to find late passengers and the country also plans to use facial recognition capabilities in a project to fit cameras and sensors on over 100,000 lamp posts. Singapore&rsquo;s government says these measures are pragmatic ways to improve people&rsquo;s lives and safety and has pledged to be sensitive to privacy. The cosmopolitan financial hub says it has been the target of militant plots for years, some stemming from its Muslim-majority neighbors, and that it&rsquo;s a matter of &lsquo;when&rsquo; and not &lsquo;if&rsquo; militants will strike.

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said the death toll was expected to rise as information comes in from areas where thousands of buildings collapsed or were badly damaged, especially in the north, the quake&rsquo;s epicenter. Power and communications were cut in some areas of Lombok, and the military said it was sending in a vessel with medical aid, supplies and logistical support for the island. Lombok was hit a week earlier, on July 29, by a 6.4 magnitude quake that killed 17 people, injured hundreds and briefly stranded several hundred trekkers on the slopes of a volcano.  The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) said that more than 120 aftershocks were recorded after Sunday evening&rsquo;s quake, whose magnitude the U.S. Geological Survey revised down to 6.9 from an original 7.0. There were no foreigners among the dead and the number of injured stood at 209, BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference. The tremor was so powerful it was felt on the neighboring island of Bali where, according to BNPB, two people died. &ldquo;THIS IS IT FOR ME IN INDONESIA&rdquo; Long lines formed at the airport of Lombok&rsquo;s main town, Mataram, as foreign visitors cut their holidays short. The Garuda Indonesia airline said it was adding extra flights from Lombok to help tourists leave. AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted that the budget airline would try to lay on extra flights, while Indonesian budget carriers Lion Air and Citilink said there had been a jump in demand for outbound flights from Lombok and Bali. &ldquo;I was at the rooftop of my hotel and the building started swaying very hard. It felt like two metres to the left, then two metres to the right, I could not stand up,&rdquo; said Gino Poggiali, a 43-year-old Frenchman, who was with his wife and two children, at the Lombok airport. His wife Maude, 44, said the family were on Bali for the first quake and Lombok for the second. &ldquo;This is it for me in Indonesia,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Next time we will stay in France or somewhere close.&rdquo; Carlos Romartinez, a 24-year-old Spaniard who was also waiting for a flight out of Lombok, said he had decided to head instead to the island of Flores to the east.  &ldquo;All the activities are shut down. We can&rsquo;t dive, we can&rsquo;t do anything so we will go to another island,&rdquo; he said. Dutch tourist Marc Ganbuwalba injured his knee as a stampede of diners rushed from a restaurant after the quake. &ldquo;We are cutting short our holiday because I can&rsquo;t walk and we&rsquo;re just not in the mood anymore, more in the mood to see our loved ones,&rdquo; said the 26-year-old, sitting on a trolley with his leg bandaged.  &ldquo;We are just thankful to god and also to the hotel staff who really helped us. Some of them said their own houses had been destroyed but they were still helping us.&rdquo; SCREAMS, SHAKING, CRACKS About 1,000 foreign and domestic tourists were evacuated in boats from the three Gili islands off the northwest coast of Lombok, BNPB spokesman Nugroho said via Twitter. No tourists died on the Gilis, he said. Singapore Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who was on the 10th floor of a hotel in Mataram when the quake struck, said that his room shook violently and walls cracked. &ldquo;It was quite impossible to stand up. Heard screams. Came out, and made my way down a staircase, while building was still shaking. Power went out for a while. Lots of cracks, fallen doors,&rdquo; he wrote on Facebook. His government issued a travel notice on Monday, advising citizens to defer travel to Lombok and urging those currently there to leave. Australia&rsquo;s Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton was on the 12th floor of a Lombok hotel when the quake struck. &ldquo;We were knocked certainly to the floor,&rdquo; he told Australian radio. &ldquo;We were pretty lucky to get out.

He said most of the shootings are connected to gang violence in the city of about 2.7 million people, the third-largest in the United States. Police said gunmen targeted a block party, a gathering after a funeral, and other gatherings on a night where thousands of people gathered for a downtown concert. Local media reported that the brunt of the violence happened in the city&rsquo;s West Side, where 25 people were shot in separate attacks. Waller touted that shootings in 2018 were down from last year. The Chicago Tribune, which has been tracking shooting statistics, reported earlier this month that shootings in the city have declined, with 533 fewer shootings as of Aug. 1 than the same time in 2017. &ldquo;By no means do these statistics show that we have a victory,&rdquo; Waller said. He said that police are working with other law enforcement groups to target gang activity. &ldquo;I promise we will not be defeated,&rdquo; Waller said.

The statements came just days after a confidential United Nations report concluded North Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile programs, in breach of U.N. resolutions.  North Korea and the United States vowed to work to end Pyongyang&rsquo;s weapons programs at a landmark summit in June in Singapore, but have struggled to reach an agreement to accomplish that goal.

The tremor was so powerful it was felt on the neighboring island of Bali where, according to BNPB, two people died. Indonesia sits on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. &ldquo;THIS IS IT FOR ME IN INDONESIA&rdquo; Long lines formed at the airport of Lombok&rsquo;s main town, Mataram, as foreign visitors cut their holidays short. The Garuda Indonesia airline said it was adding extra flights from Lombok to help tourists leave. AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted that the budget airline would try to lay on extra flights, while Indonesian budget carriers Lion Air and Citilink said there had been a jump in demand for outbound flights from Lombok and Bali. &ldquo;I was at the rooftop of my hotel and the building started swaying very hard. It felt like two meters to the left, then two meters to the right, I could not stand up,&rdquo; said Gino Poggiali, a 43-year-old Frenchman, who was with his wife and two children, at the Lombok airport. His wife Maude, 44, said the family were on Bali for the first quake and Lombok for the second. &ldquo;This is it for me in Indonesia,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Next time we will stay in France or somewhere close.&rdquo; Carlos Romartinez, a 24-year-old Spaniard who was also waiting for a flight out of Lombok, said he had decided to head instead to the island of Flores to the east.  &ldquo;All the activities are shut down. We can&rsquo;t dive, we can&rsquo;t do anything so we will go to another island,&rdquo; he said. Dutch tourist Marc Ganbuwalba injured his knee as a stampede of diners rushed from a restaurant after the quake. &ldquo;We are cutting short our holiday because I can&rsquo;t walk and we&rsquo;re just not in the mood anymore, more in the mood to see our loved ones,&rdquo; said the 26-year-old, sitting on a trolley with his leg bandaged.  &ldquo;We are just thankful to god and also to the hotel staff who really helped us. Some of them said their own houses had been destroyed but they were still helping us.&rdquo; SCREAMS, SHAKING, CRACKS About 1,000 foreign and domestic tourists were evacuated in boats from the three Gili islands off the northwest coast of Lombok, BNPB spokesman Nugroho said via Twitter.  He posted a video showing a crowd of hundreds of people crammed on a beach at one of the Gilis, apparently waiting to be ferried back to the main island. Singapore Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who was on the 10th floor of a hotel in Mataram when the quake struck, said that his room shook violently and walls cracked. &ldquo;It was quite impossible to stand up. Heard screams. Came out, and made my way down a staircase, while building was still shaking. Power went out for a while. Lots of cracks, fallen doors,&rdquo; he wrote on Facebook. His government issued a travel notice, advising citizens to defer travel to Lombok and urging those currently there to leave. Slideshow (10 Images)  Australia&rsquo;s Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton was on the 12th floor of a Lombok hotel at the time of the quake. &ldquo;We were knocked certainly to the floor,&rdquo; he told Australian radio. &ldquo;We were pretty lucky to get out. Everyone&rsquo;s a bit shaken but all well.&rdquo;    "},"dff985c8f61ba9c2bda8347b41efcdac":{"title":"Assassination attempt and protest send warning to Azerbaijan&#x27;s rulers","text":"GYANJA, Azerbaijan (Reuters) - An assassination attempt and protest in Azerbaijan&rsquo;s second city have sent a warning to the ruling elite that discontent is simmering in the tightly controlled, oil-producing state. Police have arrested a local man over the attack in which Elmar Veliyev, mayor of the northwestern city of Gyanja, was shot and wounded in front of his office on July 3.  Interior Ministry officials say the suspect, Yunis Safarov, has ties to a militant group that wants to establish Islamist rule in Azerbaijan, a secular state where most people are Shi&rsquo;ite Muslims, and that he trained with militants in Syria. They have cited no sources for the information. But some Gyanja residents challenge the ministry&rsquo;s version of events. They suggest Safarov was motivated by revenge for what they see as Veliyev&rsquo;s mistreatment of Gyanja residents and disrespect for their religious views. In a rare outbreak of violence against officialdom in the South Caucasus nation, two police officers were stabbed to death in clashes when a protest over Safarov&rsquo;s arrest and unofficial reports that he was beaten in custody turned violent on July 10. A third, Samir Bayramov, was wounded. Azerbaijan, a majority Muslim country of about 10 million, has grown wealthy from oil and natural gas since it declared  independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Protests are rare and are put down quickly. But while money has flowed into sprucing up Baku, opponents of President Ilham Aliyev say few have seen major benefits from the oil wealth, especially people outside the capital, and accuse his government of suppressing human rights and stifling democracy. Drawing parallels with Aliyev, they accuse Veliyev, 57, of treating Gyanja like a personal fief, showing no regard for the city&rsquo;s poor and being high-handed with anyone who stands in his way.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &ldquo;Veliyev has been behaving exactly the same way as Aliyev does,&rdquo; Jakhangir Amirkhanly, a 74-year-old member of the opposition Musavat Party, told Reuters in Gyanja. The unrest was brief and there is no sign of it spreading. Aliyev, who succeeded his father Heydar Aliyev as president in 2003, brooks little dissent and the opposition is weak.   The municipal authorities in Gyanja said in an emailed response to Reuters&rsquo; questions that criticism of Veliyev was &ldquo;groundless and biased.&rdquo; But the events in the city show that, with the economy heavily dependent on the energy sector and the wealth gap now huge, Azerbaijan&rsquo;s leaders could face a growing challenge to retain power in the long term if oil prices fall.  Deeply entrenched elites and long-term rulers in other countries in the region are watching closely \u2014 Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan all have economies that are reliant on energy and leaders who are nervous about any signs of unrest. Europe is also watching. Because of its energy reserves and strategic location along the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan is seen by Europe as an important alternative to Russian energy supplies, and BP (BP.L ) is a major investor in the country. Samir Bayramov, 38, a policeman wounded during protests, speaks to media in a hospital in Ganja, Azerbaijan, July 12, 2018.  REUTERS\/Staff &ldquo;ACTS OF TERRORISM&rdquo;      Aliyev has shown his concern by taking charge of the investigation into the events in Gyanja, which he has described as acts of terrorism and crimes against Azeri statehood aimed at intimidating society.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The authorities also showed their nervousness by trying to stop news of the protest spreading, city residents said. For two days afterwards, mobile telephone data services were turned off in Gyanja, making it hard to access social media, they said.       Some had used Facebook to circulate information about the events and the prosecutor&rsquo;s office has opened criminal cases against the editors of four independent Azeri websites that re-posted their entries.  Gyanja, a city of 330,000, has been administered for seven years by Veliyev, a member of the ruling party who was appointed by Aliyev. Police say four people accused of links to radical religious organizations were killed in sting operations after the assassination attempt and protest. In addition, 61 have been arrested and charged, and 13 others are wanted by police. But of 11 Gyanja residents who agreed to speak to Reuters about the events, eight doubted the assassination attempt had any link to militant Islamists and said they believed Veliyev, who is a Muslim, was attacked because he was unpopular.  None wanted to be identified for fear of reprisals except Amirkhanly, though Azeri officials deny Western charges of repressing and intimidating opponents. &ldquo;We were shocked that someone dared to take a gun and shoot  the mayor,&rdquo; a pensioner said in a Gyanja park, lowering her voice and looking round to make sure no one was eavesdropping. &ldquo;But honestly, no one was particularly worried because Veliyev did a lot of bad things in our city ... The rich became richer and the poor became beggars,&rdquo; she said.  The city administration in Gyanja defended Veliyev&rsquo;s record in office in response to Reuters&rsquo; questions. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0&ldquo;The attack ... is just a terrorist act. It&rsquo;s not connected to any particular motives, revenge or response to the supposed &lsquo;social tyranny&rsquo; by Veliyev,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Large-scale construction work has been carried out in the city. The authorities have had meetings with city residents, listened to their complaints and dealt with them effectively.&rdquo; LESSONS TO BE DRAWN  Pot-holed roads and some old buildings have been repaired in Gyanja, shopping malls have been built and a four-star Ramada Plaza hotel has been erected. The city center is dominated by a vast park named after Heydar Aliyev, who was president from 1993 until 2003. But Amirkhanly said: &ldquo;Unemployment is very high and the majority of young residents of Gyanja emigrate to Russia or Turkey.&rdquo;  An 84-year-old pensioner who declined to be named said he had been tricked by the city authorities into leaving his flat in a run-down building while it was repaired. The authorities reneged on a promise to pay for his and others&rsquo; temporary accommodation and are now trying to persuade them to cede ownership of the flats to a construction firm that wants to demolish them and build on the site, he said. The pensioner said he had managed to meet Veliyev to petition him over the property, but the mayor &ldquo;was very rude&rdquo;. The mayor&rsquo;s office did not respond directly to the pensioner&rsquo;s remarks but said it had &ldquo;no evidence of Elmar Veliyev having an unlawful attitude towards citizens&rdquo;. Aliyev&rsquo;s supporters say he has brought stability to Azerbaijan, modernized the country and forged closer ties with Europe since succeeding his father in 2003.  He won a fourth successive term in April with more than 85 percent of votes but the election was boycotted by the main opposition and its legitimacy was questioned by independent observers. Signs of public anger have flared in recent years. Protests in Baku in 2011, by crowds demanding Aliyev and his government quit, ended after a security crackdown and mass arrests.  In 2016, protests broke out in at least three cities \u2014 Quba, Siyazan and Shabran \u2014 over rising bread prices and a sharp devaluation of the manat currency as oil prices fell. Police responded with widespread arrests, residents said.  The unrest in Gyanja has also been contained. &ldquo;There is no organized opposition political force in the country that can compete with the ruling elite,&rdquo; said Ilgar Velizade, an independent political analyst. &ldquo;But the authorities should draw some lessons from the recent events and reconsider their personnel policies, pay more attention to social problems and communicate more with people.&rdquo; A $38-billion sovereign wealth fund has been set up to ease  the pain of any economic downturn. Foreign donors have also urged Baku to diversify the economy to make it less dependent on oil and gas, which make up about 75 percent of state revenues. There is little sign of it doing so, with the government expecting 2 percent growth this year after only 0.1 percent in  2017 and a 3.8 percent contraction in 2016.  The status quo may suit the West as stability helps it &ldquo;implement global energy projects in the region,&rdquo; Velizade said. The European Union&rsquo;s efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas depend partly on developing the so-called Southern Gas Corridor, which is expected by 2020 to bring about 16 billion cubic meters of gas a year to Europe via Georgia and Turkey from Azerbaijan&rsquo;s Shah Deniz field.

MSCI&rsquo;s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.5 percent, having risen about 1 percent earlier in the day. Chinese shares turned negative with the blue-chip share index and Shanghai&rsquo;s SSE Composite down 0.7 percent each. Japan&rsquo;s Nikkei was flat, while Australian shares added 0.5 percent and Hong Kong&rsquo;s Hang Seng index gained 0.7 percent. The trade dispute remains a live issue for markets with China proposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods on Friday, while a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks with Washington to resolve the bitter trade conflict. That was followed by a report in China&rsquo;s state media saying Friday&rsquo;s retaliatory tariffs were &ldquo;rational&rdquo; while accusing the United States of blackmail. At the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump said his strategy of placing steep tariffs on Chinese imports is &ldquo;working far better than anyone ever anticipated&rdquo;, citing losses in China&rsquo;s stock market. He predicted the U.S. market could &ldquo;go up dramatically&rdquo; once trade deals were renegotiated. &ldquo;The drip feed of escalating tariff threats from Trump and counter threats from China continues,&rdquo; said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital. &ldquo;With a 25 percent tariff on...(some) Chinese imports likely to commence soon, Trump is clearly ramping up the pressure on China but China is digging in,&rdquo; Oliver added.  &ldquo;A tariff of this magnitude will start to have a significant economic impact on China&rsquo;s growth, potentially knocking up to 0.5 percent off growth, and probably also on the U.S.&rdquo; At the same time, China is stepping up measures to support its currency, which has been hit by the worsening trade skirmish. Late on Friday, the People&rsquo;s Bank of China raised the reserve requirement on some foreign exchange forward positions, making it more expensive to bet against the Chinese currency and helping pull the yuan away from 14-month lows. The move boosted the Australian dollar, which is often played as a liquid proxy for the yuan. The Aussie came off two-week lows to climb as high as $0.7412 after the announcement, and was last at $0.7389.  &ldquo;Leaning against bearish CNY sentiment is important because a rapidly weakening currency risks triggering residential outflows and destabilising domestic asset prices,&rdquo; JPMorgan analysts said in a note. &ldquo;Our economists think that PBOC likely will take further action if CNY depreciation continues or capital outflow pressure increases.&rdquo; Wall Street indices gained on Friday with the Dow adding 0.54 percent, the S&P 500 0.46 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 0.12 percent. They were helped by strong corporate earnings, although gains were capped by worries over the escalating trade tensions. According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year. Other factors too are weighing over investor sentiment. &ldquo;While the possibility of a trade war is still top of mind for investors, it isn&rsquo;t the only cause for concern,&rdquo; said Lachlan McPherson, Senior Investment Consultant at Charles Schwab Australia. &ldquo;Investors are also closely watching the rising value of the U.S. dollar, slowing global economic growth and the risk of the Federal Reserve tightening short-term interest rates too quickly and dampening domestic economic growth.&rdquo; The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, has risen 3.4 percent so far this year with strong rallies since April when Trump first announced the tariffs. The index was last up 0.15 percent at 95.29. Traders see further upside in the dollar as they maintained a significantly large long position on the currency, while net short bets on the Aussie were their largest since November 2015. The British pound hovered near 11-day lows at $1.299 following remarks by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney that Britain faced an &ldquo;uncomfortably high&rdquo; risk of a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit. The euro inched down to more than 5-week lows of $1.155. Gold bounced from near 17-month lows after weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data, and was last up 0.2 percent at $1,215.45.  Meanwhile, Brent crude futures rose 22 cents to  $73.43, while U.S. crude oil futures added 28 cents to $68.77 a barrel.  "},"028948844505118d64252225ee7074ba":{"title":"U.S. bond market takes looming Treasuries deluge in stride","text":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. government debt supply will likely continue to boom, but bond market investors seem to be taking it in stride. The Treasury Department is having to sell more debt to finance the government&rsquo;s ballooning deficit, stemming from the massive federal tax overhaul in December and the spending deal passed in February. Still, bond yields have remained in a narrow range, suggesting investors may not be fretting about the swelling debt supply. &ldquo;There will be no relief from supply especially from bills going into October,&rdquo; said Tom Simons, money market strategist at Jefferies & Co in New York. Supply is expected to run high at least until the Treasury provides updated forecasts on its borrowing needs, next due in November - and might even accelerate further. This week, the Treasury will sell $34 billion in three-year notes, with $26 billion in 10-year debt on Wednesday and $18 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday. It will also auction $51 billion in three-month bills and $45 billion in six-month bills, together with an expected $65 billion in one-month bills.  The supply will fall short of a record week of $294 billion set in March but continues a trend higher since February. Analysts, who said the market would have no trouble digesting this week&rsquo;s offerings, see the government as becoming increasingly dependent on private investors for cash as the Fed further reduces its bond holdings. The goal is to shrink a balance sheet that had grown to more than $4 trillion from three massive rounds of asset purchases to combat the previous recession. &ldquo;I think they will go fine,&rdquo; Matt Freund, head of fixed income strategies at Calamos Investments in Chicago, said of this week&rsquo;s debt auctions. Analysts projected that supply will continue to climb, and that March&rsquo;s record-setting weekly amount would be eclipsed in the coming weeks.       The Treasury said on July 30 it expected to borrow $56 billion more during the third quarter than its earlier estimate, resulting in issuing $329 billion in debt securities during this period. For a graphic on U.S. debt to GDP ratio, click reut.rs\/2KnfGbJ FOCUS ON OTHER RISKS The government&rsquo;s rising debt load is a long-term concern for investors, but it is not atop their list of pressing worries. The trade dispute between Washington and Beijing and the pace of Federal Reserve&rsquo;s interest rate increases pose far graver threats to markets and the economy than more government IOUs, analysts said. &ldquo;It is a really, long-term powerful narrative, but when is it going to bite?&rdquo; Calamos&rsquo; Freund said. As long as the U.S. economy hums along and its bond yields are higher than most of its peers, appetite for U.S. Treasuries should remain solid in the foreseeable future, according to most analysts. Mild inflation and the Fed staying on a gradual rate-hike path also support U.S. bond demand, the analysts have said. &ldquo;From an absolute yield perspective, where else are you going to go?&rdquo; said Eric Souza, senior portfolio manager at SVB Asset Management in San Francisco. On Friday, benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR slipped over 3 basis points at 2.952 percent following a mixed July payrolls report. Yields move inversely to prices.  The U.S. 10-year yield is running 2.50 percentage points above its German counterpart DE10YT=RR and 2.85 points higher than Japanese 10-year yield JP10YT=RR.  The U.S. budget gap is forecast to hit $1 trillion in fiscal year 2020, compared with $804 billion in the fiscal 2018, according to the Congressional Budget Office.     Given the growing deficit, the government has ramped up its issuance of bills and shorter-dated coupon debt to meet its funding needs after the suspension of the federal debt ceiling earlier this year.

The Aussie came off two-week lows to climb as high as $0.7412 after the announcement, and was last at $0.7389.  &ldquo;Leaning against bearish CNY sentiment is important because a rapidly weakening currency risks triggering residential outflows and destabilising domestic asset prices,&rdquo; JPMorgan analysts said in a note. &ldquo;Our economists think that PBOC likely will take further action if CNY depreciation continues or capital outflow pressure increases.&rdquo; Wall Street indices gained on Friday with the Dow adding 0.54 percent, the S&P 500 0.46 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 0.12 percent. They were helped by strong corporate earnings, although gains were capped by worries over the escalating trade tensions. According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year. Other factors too are weighing over investor sentiment. &ldquo;While the possibility of a trade war is still top of mind for investors, it isn&rsquo;t the only cause for concern,&rdquo; said Lachlan McPherson, Senior Investment Consultant at Charles Schwab Australia. &ldquo;Investors are also closely watching the rising value of the U.S. dollar, slowing global economic growth and the risk of the Federal Reserve tightening short-term interest rates too quickly and dampening domestic economic growth.&rdquo; The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, has risen 3.4 percent so far this year with strong rallies since April when Trump first announced the tariffs. The index was last up 0.15 percent at 95.29. Traders see further upside in the dollar as they maintained a significantly large long position on the currency, while net short bets on the Aussie were their largest since November 2015. The British pound hovered near 11-day lows at $1.299 following remarks by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney that Britain faced an &ldquo;uncomfortably high&rdquo; risk of a &ldquo;no deal&rdquo; Brexit. The euro inched down to more than 5-week lows of $1.155. Gold bounced from near 17-month lows after weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data, and was last up 0.2 percent at $1,215.45.  Meanwhile, Brent crude futures rose 22 cents to  $73.43, while U.S. crude oil futures added 28 cents to $68.77 a barrel.

"},"fbb30b260adb23bb6177562ff7aa8cd8":{"title":"U.S. bond market takes looming Treasuries deluge in stride","text":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. government debt supply will likely continue to boom, but bond market investors seem to be taking it in stride. The Treasury Department is having to sell more debt to finance the government&rsquo;s ballooning deficit, stemming from the massive federal tax overhaul in December and the spending deal passed in February. Still, bond yields have remained in a narrow range, suggesting investors may not be fretting about the swelling debt supply. &ldquo;There will be no relief from supply especially from bills going into October,&rdquo; said Tom Simons, money market strategist at Jefferies & Co in New York. Supply is expected to run high at least until the Treasury provides updated forecasts on its borrowing needs, next due in November - and might even accelerate further. This week, the Treasury will sell $34 billion in three-year notes, with $26 billion in 10-year debt on Wednesday and $18 billion in 30-year bonds on Thursday. It will also auction $51 billion in three-month bills and $45 billion in six-month bills, together with an expected $65 billion in one-month bills.  The supply will fall short of a record week of $294 billion set in March but continues a trend higher since February. Analysts, who said the market would have no trouble digesting this week&rsquo;s offerings, see the government as becoming increasingly dependent on private investors for cash as the Fed further reduces its bond holdings. The goal is to shrink a balance sheet that had grown to more than $4 trillion from three massive rounds of asset purchases to combat the previous recession. &ldquo;I think they will go fine,&rdquo; Matt Freund, head of fixed income strategies at Calamos Investments in Chicago, said of this week&rsquo;s debt auctions. Analysts projected that supply will continue to climb, and that March&rsquo;s record-setting weekly amount would be eclipsed in the coming weeks.       The Treasury said on July 30 it expected to borrow $56 billion more during the third quarter than its earlier estimate, resulting in issuing $329 billion in debt securities during this period. For a graphic on U.S. debt to GDP ratio, click reut.rs\/2KnfGbJ FOCUS ON OTHER RISKS The government&rsquo;s rising debt load is a long-term concern for investors, but it is not atop their list of pressing worries. The trade dispute between Washington and Beijing and the pace of Federal Reserve&rsquo;s interest rate increases pose far graver threats to markets and the economy than more government IOUs, analysts said. &ldquo;It is a really, long-term powerful narrative, but when is it going to bite?&rdquo; Calamos&rsquo; Freund said. As long as the U.S. economy hums along and its bond yields are higher than most of its peers, appetite for U.S. Treasuries should remain solid in the foreseeable future, according to most analysts. Mild inflation and the Fed staying on a gradual rate-hike path also support U.S. bond demand, the analysts have said. &ldquo;From an absolute yield perspective, where else are you going to go?&rdquo; said Eric Souza, senior portfolio manager at SVB Asset Management in San Francisco. On Friday, benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR slipped over 3 basis points at 2.952 percent following a mixed July payrolls report. Yields move inversely to prices.  The U.S. 10-year yield is running 2.50 percentage points above its German counterpart DE10YT=RR and 2.85 points higher than Japanese 10-year yield JP10YT=RR.  The U.S. budget gap is forecast to hit $1 trillion in fiscal year 2020, compared with $804 billion in the fiscal 2018, according to the Congressional Budget Office.     Given the growing deficit, the government has ramped up its issuance of bills and shorter-dated coupon debt to meet its funding needs after the suspension of the federal debt ceiling earlier this year.

China proposed retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from liquefied natural gas (LNG) to some aircraft on Friday, following a proposal by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump for a higher 25 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports.  The increasingly heated rhetoric between Beijing and Washington has rattled global markets worried about the impact on world trade and growth, with few signs either side is willing to make significant concessions.  Economists say that tariffs on $34 billion of China&rsquo;s exports to the United States, which went into effect on July 6, so far are not having a significant impact on overall Chinese exports.  July exports are predicted to have risen 10 percent year-on-year, according to median estimates from 37 economists, compared to 11.2 percent growth in June. While July&rsquo;s forecast does not point to any sharp slowdown, economists do see headwinds mounting for China&rsquo;s massive export sector.  &ldquo;In addition to the tariffs impact, there might be some impact from front-loading of orders in previous months,&rdquo; said Betty Wang, Senior China Economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.  &ldquo;There will be some gradual impacts that could be seen over the following months, as this is the first month the tariffs were implemented.&rdquo;  ANZ forecasts China&rsquo;s exports rose 6.4 percent in July.  SORE POINT  Markets will be closely watching the data on two-way trade between the world&rsquo;s two biggest economies, as well as China&rsquo;s trade surplus with the United States, a sore point in the trade relationship. The $34 billion of Chinese exports impacted by current tariffs amount to less than 7 percent of its total exports to the United States last year. Trump, however, has effectively threatened to slap tariffs on all of China&rsquo;s shipments to the United States, the Asian giant&rsquo;s largest export market.  China&rsquo;s surplus with the U.S. swelled to a record in June as exports continued to rise, though signs of front-loading orders suggest the spike may have been a one-off. China&rsquo;s imports are expected to have risen 16.2 percent in July, picking up from 14.1 percent growth in June.  The poll showed China&rsquo;s overall trade surplus likely fell to $39.33 billion in July, from $41.61 billion in June, though that amount would be China&rsquo;s second-highest surplus of the year.  There was no separate forecast on China&rsquo;s trade surplus with the United States which has continued to grow even as its total surplus has narrowed over the last two years. China ran a $375 billion goods trade surplus with the United States in 2017, which Trump has said is unacceptable.   Chinese officials have vowed to retaliate against any further U.S. measures, though they have also taken steps in recent weeks to shore up economic growth and have warned of the risks of job losses as a result of the trade war.   These measures could help mitigate a broader impact to economic growth, economists say.  &ldquo;China has made it very clear it is going to boost infrastructure investment for the second half of the year,&rdquo; said ANZ&rsquo;s Wang. &ldquo;That would support overall GDP growth momentum even though we see more downside risk and uncertainties around the export sector.&rdquo;  "},"103d4dd6137cdd1401ac39b436c19044":{"title":"China&#x27;s July exports growth still seen holding up despite U.S. tariffs: Reuters poll","text":"BEIJING (Reuters) - China&rsquo;s exports are expected to have maintained solid growth in July despite new tariffs on billions of dollars of shipments to the United States, though the outlook has darkened as both sides raised the stakes in a trade conflict that has rattled financial markets.

But a new pipeline that will carry gas direct from Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany is doing rather less for friendship, driving a wedge between Germany and its allies and giving Chancellor Angela Merkel a headache. For U.S. President Donald Trump, Nord Stream 2 is a &ldquo;horrific&rdquo; pipeline that will increase Germany&rsquo;s dependence on Russian energy. Ukraine, fighting Russian-backed separatists, fears the new pipeline will allow Moscow to cut it out of the lucrative and strategically crucial gas transit business. It comes at an awkward time for Merkel. With the fraying of the transatlantic alliance and an assertive Russia and China, she has acknowledged that Germany must take more of a political leadership role in Europe. &ldquo;The global order is under pressure,&rdquo; Merkel said last month. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a challenge for us ... Germany&rsquo;s responsibility is growing; Germany has more work to do.&rdquo; In April she accepted for the first time that there were &ldquo;political considerations&rdquo; to Nord Stream 2, a project she had until then described as a commercial venture. Most European countries want Germany to do more to project European influence and protect eastern neighbors that are nervous of Russian encroachment. But letting Russia sell gas to Germany while avoiding Ukraine does the opposite, depriving Kiev of transit revenues and making it, Poland and the Baltic states more vulnerable to cuts in gas supplies. FILE PHOTO: A man walks by a stack of North Stream 2 pipes in Kotka, Finland, June 8, 2017. REUTERS\/Axel Schmidt\/File Photo &ldquo;The price would be an even greater loss of trust from the Baltics, Poland and Ukraine,&rdquo; said Roderich Kiesewetter, a Merkel ally on the parliamentary foreign affairs committee. &ldquo;We Germans always say that holding the West together is our &lsquo;center of gravity&rsquo;, but the Russian approach has succeeded in dragging Germany, at least in terms of energy policy, out of this western solidarity.&rdquo; Many analysts say the business case for Nord Stream 2 is thin. Another pipeline already links Russia and Germany under the Baltic. Nord Stream 2 will double capacity but future demand is uncertain. On the flip side, German industry likes anything that will provide energy more cheaply. Merkel&rsquo;s Social Democrat coalition partners, the leading voices in Germany calling for a conciliatory approach towards Russia, are also in favor. The issue has divided Berlin&rsquo;s political class. The parties agreed in their coalition talks earlier this year to make a commitment to the pipeline, but did not put it in writing. According to Margarita Assenova, an analyst at the Centre for European Policy Analysis who is critical of Nord Stream 2, Russia can double gas exports to Europe via existing Ukrainian pipelines without building the new conduit. But despite opposition from European partners, from Washington and from within Merkel&rsquo;s party, Nord Stream 2 continues. Germany&rsquo;s diplomatic ambitions are being thwarted by the project&rsquo;s brutal business logic.     FILE PHOTO: Floating excavators prepare an underwater trench for the North Stream 2 pipeline close to Lubmin, Germany, May 15, 2018.  REUTERS\/Axel Schmidt\/File Photo OSTPOLITIK On the other hand, it has the strong backing of Gazprom, Russia&rsquo;s state-owned energy giant which owns Nord Stream 2 AG, the project company. Its boss Matthias Warnig, once an East German spy tasked with reporting on West German business, is seen as one of Berlin&rsquo;s most formidable lobbyists. The pipeline is one of a network of Kremlin-sponsored projects seemingly designed to circumvent Ukraine, the largest and most troublesome of the countries once ruled from Moscow. They include Turk Stream, which crosses the Black Sea to bypass Ukraine to the south. Lawmakers say Warnig has responded to their skeptical queries about the project by promising to take their concerns direct to Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding to the sense that the pipeline serves the Kremlin&rsquo;s strategic interests. But, for Gazprom, it makes sense: transit across a country with which Russia is in an undeclared war is risky and increasingly unreliable as Ukraine&rsquo;s Soviet-era pipelines grow older. Germany and the European Union are attempting to broker an agreement between Moscow and Kiev to keep the gas flowing across Ukraine when the current transit contract ends in 2019. Critics say this means European consumers will pay a subsidy to help keep Ukraine afloat. In the SPD, sympathy for Nord Stream 2 runs deep. Gerhard Schroeder, the party&rsquo;s last chancellor, was appointed to senior positions at Russian energy companies after leaving office and regards Putin as a close friend. For many of Schroeder&rsquo;s generation, cooperation with Russia is in the tradition of the &ldquo;Ostpolitik&rdquo; of their hero, 1970s Chancellor Willy Brandt, who defied a skeptical Washington to reach out to the Soviet Bloc, now seen as a prelude towards ending the Cold War. But a younger generation in the party, often critical of Schroeder&rsquo;s links to the Kremlin, is more cautious. Germany is bound to Russia by decades of cooperation on energy supply, but it has to offer something to its western allies too, officials say. That cooperation goes a long way: last week, Merkel hosted Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Berlin. He was accompanied by Russian general staff chief Valery Gerasimov, who has been banned from the EU since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Keeping lines open to the Kremlin is popular in Germany, where polls show people are better-disposed towards Russia than in almost any country. Increasingly, though, officials wonder if Germany is not paying too high a price in lost face. "},"65cbd55316b96d35d025c644e97c24e8":{"title":"North Korea says demonstrating good faith, urges U.S. to drop sanctions","text":"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean state media called on Monday for the United States to drop sanctions, saying Pyongyang had demonstrated good faith by ending its nuclear weapons testing and handing over the remains of U.S. troops killed in the Korean War. The statements came just days after a confidential United Nations report concluded North Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile programs, in breach of U.N. resolutions, and has continued to conduct illegal trades of oil, coal and other commodities.  North Korea and the United States vowed to work to end Pyongyang&rsquo;s weapons programs at a landmark summit in June in Singapore, but have struggled to reach an agreement to accomplish that goal.     The North&rsquo;s state media accused Washington of &ldquo;acting opposite&rdquo; to its plan to improve ties, despite Pyongyang making goodwill gestures, including a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear site, and the return of the remains of U.S. soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean War.  Such &ldquo;practical measures&rdquo; had already deprived U.N. Security Council resolutions of their reason for being, said the Rodong Sinmun, a ruling Workers&rsquo; Party mouthpiece.  &ldquo;There have been outrageous arguments coming out of the U.S. State Department that it won&rsquo;t ease sanctions until a denuclearisation is completed, and reinforcing sanctions is a way to raise its negotiating power,&rdquo; the newspaper said in an editorial.  FILE PHOTO - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shakes hands with North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho at the Asean Regional Forum Retreat in Singapore August 4, 2018. REUTERS\/Edgar Su\/File Photo &ldquo;How could the sanctions, which were a stick the U.S. administration had brandished as part of its hostile policy against us, promote the two countries&rsquo; amity?&rdquo; The editorial, which was run along with front page articles and photos of leader Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s visit to a catfish farm, was a fresh sign of Pyongyang&rsquo;s frustration over the slow-moving nuclear negotiations.  Under U.S. President Donald Trump, the United States pushed the United Nations to impose tough sanctions on North Korea as Kim conducted a string of missile and nuclear tests last year. At a security forum on Saturday, the two sides sparred over the Singapore agreement, with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling for maintaining sanctions against Pyongyang, and his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, criticizing Washington for &ldquo;retreating&rdquo; from ending the war during a speech. Pompeo suggested the North&rsquo;s continued work on its weapons programs was inconsistent with Kim&rsquo;s commitment to denuclearize, although he expressed optimism the process would be achieved. On his way back to Washington, Pompeo played down the exchange of remarks with Ri, saying the tone was far different than it was last year. &ldquo;The minister made very clear of their continued commitment to denuclearize,&rdquo; Pompeo told reporters traveling with him. &ldquo;I probably don&rsquo;t have his words exactly right, but it&rsquo;s pretty close. Compare the anger, frankly, over years and years, and hatred, as spewed by the North Koreans; his comments were different.&rdquo; FILE PHOTO: A North Korean flag flies on a mast at the Permanent Mission of North Korea in Geneva October 2, 2014.   REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse\/File Photo  North Korea&rsquo;s propaganda websites on Monday also urged the United States to drop sanctions and build trust.  One outlet, Uriminzokkiri, lambasted the sanctions and pressure campaign as &ldquo;anachronistic&rdquo; and a hurdle for better relations, calling for efforts to officially declare an end to the Korea War.

"},"64aa7ed71364f90edce6c340f0a69a08":{"title":"North Korea says demonstrating good faith, urges U.S. to drop sanctions","text":"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean state media called on Monday for the United States to drop sanctions, saying Pyongyang had demonstrated good faith by ending its nuclear weapons testing and handing over the remains of U.S. troops killed in the Korean War. The statements came just days after a confidential United Nations report concluded North Korea has not stopped its nuclear and missile programs, in breach of U.N. resolutions, and has continued to conduct illegal trades of oil, coal and other commodities.  North Korea and the United States vowed to work to end Pyongyang&rsquo;s weapons programs at a landmark summit in June in Singapore, but have struggled to reach an agreement to accomplish that goal.     The North&rsquo;s state media accused Washington of &ldquo;acting opposite&rdquo; to its plan to improve ties, despite Pyongyang making goodwill gestures, including a moratorium on nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of a nuclear site, and the return of the remains of U.S. soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean War.  Such &ldquo;practical measures&rdquo; had already deprived U.N. Security Council resolutions of their reason for being, said the Rodong Sinmun, a ruling Workers&rsquo; Party mouthpiece.  &ldquo;There have been outrageous arguments coming out of the U.S. State Department that it won&rsquo;t ease sanctions until a denuclearisation is completed, and reinforcing sanctions is a way to raise its negotiating power,&rdquo; the newspaper said in an editorial.

REUTERS\/Edgar Su\/File Photo &ldquo;How could the sanctions, which were a stick the U.S. administration had brandished as part of its hostile policy against us, promote the two countries&rsquo; amity?&rdquo; The editorial, which was run along with front page articles and photos of leader Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s visit to a catfish farm, was a fresh sign of Pyongyang&rsquo;s frustration over the slow-moving nuclear negotiations.  Under U.S. President Donald Trump, the United States pushed the United Nations to impose tough sanctions on North Korea as Kim conducted a string of missile and nuclear tests last year. At a security forum on Saturday, the two sides sparred over the Singapore agreement, with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling for maintaining sanctions against Pyongyang, and his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, criticizing Washington for &ldquo;retreating&rdquo; from ending the war during a speech. Pompeo suggested the North&rsquo;s continued work on its weapons programs was inconsistent with Kim&rsquo;s commitment to denuclearize, although he expressed optimism the process would be achieved. On his way back to Washington, Pompeo played down the exchange of remarks with Ri, saying the tone was far different than it was last year. &ldquo;The minister made very clear of their continued commitment to denuclearize,&rdquo; Pompeo told reporters traveling with him. &ldquo;I probably don&rsquo;t have his words exactly right, but it&rsquo;s pretty close. Compare the anger, frankly, over years and years, and hatred, as spewed by the North Koreans; his comments were different.&rdquo; FILE PHOTO: A North Korean flag flies on a mast at the Permanent Mission of North Korea in Geneva October 2, 2014.   REUTERS\/Denis Balibouse\/File Photo  North Korea&rsquo;s propaganda websites on Monday also urged the United States to drop sanctions and build trust.  One outlet, Uriminzokkiri, lambasted the sanctions and pressure campaign as &ldquo;anachronistic&rdquo; and a hurdle for better relations, calling for efforts to officially declare an end to the Korea War.  The Korean War ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty, leaving the U.S.-led United Nations forces, including South Korea, technically still at war with the North.

But a new pipeline that will carry gas direct from Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany is doing rather less for friendship, driving a wedge between Germany and its allies and giving Chancellor Angela Merkel a headache. For U.S. President Donald Trump, Nord Stream 2 is a &ldquo;horrific&rdquo; pipeline that will increase Germany&rsquo;s dependence on Russian energy. Ukraine, fighting Russian-backed separatists, fears the new pipeline will allow Moscow to cut it out of the lucrative and strategically crucial gas transit business. It comes at an awkward time for Merkel. With the fraying of the transatlantic alliance and an assertive Russia and China, she has acknowledged that Germany must take more of a political leadership role in Europe. &ldquo;The global order is under pressure,&rdquo; Merkel said last month. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a challenge for us ... Germany&rsquo;s responsibility is growing; Germany has more work to do.&rdquo; In April she accepted for the first time that there were &ldquo;political considerations&rdquo; to Nord Stream 2, a project she had until then described as a commercial venture. Most European countries want Germany to do more to project European influence and protect eastern neighbors that are nervous of Russian encroachment. But letting Russia sell gas to Germany while avoiding Ukraine does the opposite, depriving Kiev of transit revenues and making it, Poland and the Baltic states more vulnerable to cuts in gas supplies. FILE PHOTO: A man walks by a stack of North Stream 2 pipes in Kotka, Finland, June 8, 2017. REUTERS\/Axel Schmidt\/File Photo &ldquo;The price would be an even greater loss of trust from the Baltics, Poland and Ukraine,&rdquo; said Roderich Kiesewetter, a Merkel ally on the parliamentary foreign affairs committee. &ldquo;We Germans always say that holding the West together is our &lsquo;center of gravity&rsquo;, but the Russian approach has succeeded in dragging Germany, at least in terms of energy policy, out of this western solidarity.&rdquo; Many analysts say the business case for Nord Stream 2 is thin. Another pipeline already links Russia and Germany under the Baltic. Nord Stream 2 will double capacity but future demand is uncertain. On the flip side, German industry likes anything that will provide energy more cheaply. Merkel&rsquo;s Social Democrat coalition partners, the leading voices in Germany calling for a conciliatory approach towards Russia, are also in favor. The issue has divided Berlin&rsquo;s political class. The parties agreed in their coalition talks earlier this year to make a commitment to the pipeline, but did not put it in writing. According to Margarita Assenova, an analyst at the Centre for European Policy Analysis who is critical of Nord Stream 2, Russia can double gas exports to Europe via existing Ukrainian pipelines without building the new conduit. But despite opposition from European partners, from Washington and from within Merkel&rsquo;s party, Nord Stream 2 continues. Germany&rsquo;s diplomatic ambitions are being thwarted by the project&rsquo;s brutal business logic.     FILE PHOTO: Floating excavators prepare an underwater trench for the North Stream 2 pipeline close to Lubmin, Germany, May 15, 2018.  REUTERS\/Axel Schmidt\/File Photo OSTPOLITIK On the other hand, it has the strong backing of Gazprom, Russia&rsquo;s state-owned energy giant which owns Nord Stream 2 AG, the project company. Its boss Matthias Warnig, once an East German spy tasked with reporting on West German business, is seen as one of Berlin&rsquo;s most formidable lobbyists. The pipeline is one of a network of Kremlin-sponsored projects seemingly designed to circumvent Ukraine, the largest and most troublesome of the countries once ruled from Moscow. They include Turk Stream, which crosses the Black Sea to bypass Ukraine to the south. Lawmakers say Warnig has responded to their skeptical queries about the project by promising to take their concerns direct to Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding to the sense that the pipeline serves the Kremlin&rsquo;s strategic interests. But, for Gazprom, it makes sense: transit across a country with which Russia is in an undeclared war is risky and increasingly unreliable as Ukraine&rsquo;s Soviet-era pipelines grow older. Germany and the European Union are attempting to broker an agreement between Moscow and Kiev to keep the gas flowing across Ukraine when the current transit contract ends in 2019. Critics say this means European consumers will pay a subsidy to help keep Ukraine afloat. In the SPD, sympathy for Nord Stream 2 runs deep. Gerhard Schroeder, the party&rsquo;s last chancellor, was appointed to senior positions at Russian energy companies after leaving office and regards Putin as a close friend. For many of Schroeder&rsquo;s generation, cooperation with Russia is in the tradition of the &ldquo;Ostpolitik&rdquo; of their hero, 1970s Chancellor Willy Brandt, who defied a skeptical Washington to reach out to the Soviet Bloc, now seen as a prelude towards ending the Cold War. But a younger generation in the party, often critical of Schroeder&rsquo;s links to the Kremlin, is more cautious. Germany is bound to Russia by decades of cooperation on energy supply, but it has to offer something to its western allies too, officials say. That cooperation goes a long way: last week, Merkel hosted Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Berlin. He was accompanied by Russian general staff chief Valery Gerasimov, who has been banned from the EU since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Keeping lines open to the Kremlin is popular in Germany, where polls show people are better-disposed towards Russia than in almost any country. Increasingly, though, officials wonder if Germany is not paying too high a price in lost face.

Dallas-based Kosmos, which currently operates in Africa and South America, will pay $925 million in cash and $300 million in Kosmos common stock to acquire DGE, with the transaction expected to close towards the end of the third quarter. Acquiring DGE&rsquo;s business will increase Kosmos&rsquo; production by more than 50 percent to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) from around 45,000 boed now, with the company&rsquo;s estimated reserves rising 40 percent to around 280 million barrels of oil equivalent, the statement said. &ldquo;The best deepwater assets can compete with the best of shale, and now is a good time to enter the Gulf of Mexico,&rdquo; Andrew Inglis, chairman and chief executive officer of Kosmos, said in the statement. Speaking with Reuters, Inglis said the exit in recent years of a number of exploration and production companies from the Gulf of Mexico to invest more in onshore shale projects had created a space in the market for Kosmos to exploit. It had been able to secure high quality assets without the level of competition that energy firms might experience in other places, he said. In the London Stock Exchange statement, Kosmos noted the DGE acquisition would be &ldquo;immediately accretive&rdquo; to the company and the &ldquo;significant free cash flow&rdquo; that the assets would help generate would allow it to pay a dividend to shareholders starting in the first quarter of 2019. DGE had been backed by energy-focused private equity firm First Reserve since 2005, according to the company&rsquo;s website.

Washington and Beijing have been locked in a tit-for-tat trade battle, with both sides slapping steep tariffs on each other&rsquo;s goods in a fight that has sparked dire warnings of economic doom and gloom.  With companies hit hardest by the tariffs such as soybean producers and auto manufacturers grappling to relieve pain from the conflict, consultancies on international trade have been cashing in. Firms like Deringer in the United States and ETCN in China say they have been giving advice to clients ranging from which countries to turn to for alternative sources of supply to how to legally re-classify products to avoid tariffs. &ldquo;Our value has never been higher ... when I talk to people, they are desperate for the expertise,&rdquo; said Robert Stein, vice president of Mohawk Global Trade Advisors in the United States. He added that the company, which provides international trade consultancy services from offices in five U.S. states, has seen a 20-percent jump in consulting activity since the trade war began heating up, around the first quarter of this year. Amy Magnus, director of customs affairs and compliance at Deringer, said her firm had seen increasing appetite for its consulting services, with particular interest in so-called tariff engineering - structuring the production process to legally sidestep tariffs.  &ldquo;A company might import components, partially assembled product, or change the final product in a way that changes the classification of the good to a new product - one that is not subject to the tariff,&rdquo; said Magnus.  Deringer says on its website that it is the largest privately held customs broker in North America.  U.S. imports from China that will be most affected by tariffs include cell phones, telecommunications equipment, toys and sporting equipment, while U.S. exports to China that will be hit include civil aircraft, plane engines, cars and soybeans. IT GETS KNOCKED DOWN? One medium-sized U.S. gardening equipment supplier which has just hired a logistics expert is considering &ldquo;complete knock-downs&rdquo; for products that may be affected by tariffs, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  That would mean products sold by the firm that are usually made in China would instead be shipped to the United States as individual components before being assembled there, thus avoiding tariffs on the finished items, he said.

REUTERS\/Jason Lee\/File Photo The source declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to media and did not want the company to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Meanwhile, Chinese import and export consultancy ETCN in the first-half of 2018 saw a 40 percent on-year increase in U.S. users of its website, which sets out compliance and customs information.  The firm charges different rates for services ranging from access to real-time tariff information and trade data to an online database of company trade histories.   Its U.S.-registered members doubled in April from a year before, the company told Reuters.  Supplier sourcing is also a hot topic, with companies potentially shifting to buy raw materials or components from nations not subject to tariffs. &ldquo;U.S. companies that have China based supply chains are exploring how they might incorporate other countries like Vietnam or Thailand into their network of vendors,&rdquo; said Richard Morgan, chief executive of business advisory Equus Global Associates, which has seen an increase in billable hours as existing clients evaluate the impact of tariffs.  Consultancies in other countries are also seeing the knock-on effect of growing global trade tensions, especially across the U.S. border in Canada.  &ldquo;People are confused. People are ... not panicking, but we are definitely seeing an increase in (tariff) enquiries,&rdquo; said Igor Chigrin, co-founder of small Canadian import and export consultancy Win Global Partners. He said the firm had seen a 15 percent increase in business since trade tensions started to intensify, and expects another 50 percent jump over the second-half of the year.  GETTING BIG Anticipating an influx of work in the next couple of months, some consultants have been considering expansion. Mohawk Global may grow its so-called &lsquo;duty drawback&rsquo; department as a result of the recent spike in business. Duty drawback allows for the recovery of duty on goods that are imported to the United States before being exported.

The Federal Statistics Office said on Monday that contracts for &lsquo;Made in Germany&rsquo; goods fell by 4.0 percent after an increase of 2.6  percent the previous month. The June reading, the biggest fall in German industrial orders since January 2017, undershot a Reuters poll of analysts who had predicted a 0.4 percent decrease. &ldquo;Disappointing new orders data show tentative signs of trade tensions hitting the German economy, which doesn&rsquo;t bode well for the industrial outlook in the second half of the year,&rdquo; ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said. The overall drop in industrial orders was driven by a 4.7 percent decline in foreign demand, with orders from countries outside the euro zone falling the most. A sector breakdown showed that orders for capital goods and consumer goods came in particularly weak. The Economy Ministry said that industrial orders fell by 1.6 percent on the quarter in the April-June period. It also pointed to trade tensions caused by U.S. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s tariff policies. &ldquo;Regarding the latest development, uncertainty caused by trade policy probably played a role,&rdquo; the ministry said.

Washington and Beijing have been locked in a tit-for-tat trade battle, with both sides slapping steep tariffs on each other&rsquo;s goods in a fight that has sparked dire warnings of economic doom and gloom.  With companies hit hardest by the tariffs such as soybean producers and auto manufacturers grappling to relieve pain from the conflict, consultancies on international trade have been cashing in. Firms like Deringer in the United States and ETCN in China say they have been giving advice to clients ranging from which countries to turn to for alternative sources of supply to how to legally re-classify products to avoid tariffs. &ldquo;Our value has never been higher ... when I talk to people, they are desperate for the expertise,&rdquo; said Robert Stein, vice president of Mohawk Global Trade Advisors in the United States. He added that the company, which provides international trade consultancy services from offices in five U.S. states, has seen a 20-percent jump in consulting activity since the trade war began heating up, around the first quarter of this year. Amy Magnus, director of customs affairs and compliance at Deringer, said her firm had seen increasing appetite for its consulting services, with particular interest in so-called tariff engineering - structuring the production process to legally sidestep tariffs.  &ldquo;A company might import components, partially assembled product, or change the final product in a way that changes the classification of the good to a new product - one that is not subject to the tariff,&rdquo; said Magnus.  Deringer says on its website that it is the largest privately held customs broker in North America.  U.S. imports from China that will be most affected by tariffs include cell phones, telecommunications equipment, toys and sporting equipment, while U.S. exports to China that will be hit include civil aircraft, plane engines, cars and soybeans. IT GETS KNOCKED DOWN? One medium-sized U.S. gardening equipment supplier which has just hired a logistics expert is considering &ldquo;complete knock-downs&rdquo; for products that may be affected by tariffs, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  That would mean products sold by the firm that are usually made in China would instead be shipped to the United States as individual components before being assembled there, thus avoiding tariffs on the finished items, he said.

REUTERS\/Jason Lee\/File Photo The source declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to media and did not want the company to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Meanwhile, Chinese import and export consultancy ETCN in the first-half of 2018 saw a 40 percent on-year increase in U.S. users of its website, which sets out compliance and customs information.  The firm charges different rates for services ranging from access to real-time tariff information and trade data to an online database of company trade histories.   Its U.S.-registered members doubled in April from a year before, the company told Reuters.  Supplier sourcing is also a hot topic, with companies potentially shifting to buy raw materials or components from nations not subject to tariffs. &ldquo;U.S. companies that have China based supply chains are exploring how they might incorporate other countries like Vietnam or Thailand into their network of vendors,&rdquo; said Richard Morgan, chief executive of business advisory Equus Global Associates, which has seen an increase in billable hours as existing clients evaluate the impact of tariffs.  Consultancies in other countries are also seeing the knock-on effect of growing global trade tensions, especially across the U.S. border in Canada.  &ldquo;People are confused. People are ... not panicking, but we are definitely seeing an increase in (tariff) enquiries,&rdquo; said Igor Chigrin, co-founder of small Canadian import and export consultancy Win Global Partners. He said the firm had seen a 15 percent increase in business since trade tensions started to intensify, and expects another 50 percent jump over the second-half of the year.  GETTING BIG Anticipating an influx of work in the next couple of months, some consultants have been considering expansion. Mohawk Global may grow its so-called &lsquo;duty drawback&rsquo; department as a result of the recent spike in business. Duty drawback allows for the recovery of duty on goods that are imported to the United States before being exported.

The first day of hearings into Australia&rsquo;s A$2.6 trillion ($1.9 trillion) pension system heard that a unit of NAB, the country&rsquo;s fourth-largest bank, had charged customers &ldquo;plan service fees&rdquo; for advice they did not receive. The misconduct occurred between 2012 and 2017 and affected more than 220,000 customers, barrister assisting the inquiry, Michael Hodge, said. The NAB subsidiary had promised to pay A$87 million ($64.3 million) in compensation, he added.  Under questioning, Paul Carter, a former executive general manager for NAB&rsquo;s wealth division, said that in 2016 management had considered whether it could keep the money that had been misappropriated from customers. FILE PHOTO: Workers walk on the streets of Sydney, Australia, September 4, 2017. REUTERS\/Steven SaphoreFile Photo &ldquo;You looked at that time at various justifications for why NAB might not need to refund that money to customers?&rdquo; Hodge asked. To which Carter replied: &ldquo;I would rephrase that to say we were conducting an investigation to understand the issues and make sure the right decision was ultimately made for customers.&rdquo; The powerful Royal Commission inquiry has already roiled the banking and funds-management industry and now it is the turn of Australia&rsquo;s pension fund sector to answer questions about alleged misconduct and poor performance. AMP Ltd (AMP.AX ), Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX ), IOOF Ltd (IFL.AX ), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ.AX ) and Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX ) have also charged thousands of customers fees for advice that was not provided, Hodges said. In his opening remarks at the start of hearings into the retirement system that are expected to last two weeks, Hodge said Australian pension funds were &ldquo;surrounded by temptation&rdquo; to put profits ahead of people. He said the inquiry would examine the so-called fees-for-no-service problem from the perspective of the trustees who manufacture the retirement products.  The inquiry has already exposed similar practices throughout the banking and wealth management industries, wiping billions of dollars off the value of some of Australia&rsquo;s biggest firms as investors brace for higher compliance costs and stricter regulation. Pension funds in Australia operate as trusts, which means they must adhere to various laws such as ensuring investments are made prudently and members cared for.     In an attempt to contain the public backlash, late last month NAB announced it would stop charging such plan service fees for selected products. Both NAB and CBA have announced plans to offload their wealth management and pension funds, two of the country&rsquo;s largest, in the wake of the inquiry&rsquo;s damaging disclosures. The latest round of hearings may pile more pressure on the shares of the country&rsquo;s four biggest banks and top financial planner AMP - all of which the Royal Commission has called to appear in relation to their pension businesses. Australia has the third-largest pension pool in the world, according to OECD data, due to laws requiring employers to pay nearly a tenth of every worker&rsquo;s wage into a fund the person cannot usually access until retirement.

Drillers cut two oil rigs in the week to Aug. 3, bringing the total count down to 859, Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. Many U.S. shale oil drillers posted disappointing quarterly results in recent weeks, hit by rising operating costs, hedging losses and a fall in crude prices away from 2018 highs reached between May and July. Outside the United States, top crude exporter Saudi Arabia pumped around 10.29 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July, two OPEC sources said on Friday, down about 200,000 bpd from a month earlier.

U.S. investment bank Jefferies said in a note that &ldquo;the Saudi and Russian production surges appear to be more limited&rdquo; than initially expected, adding that bullish market sentiment was also fueled by the imminent reinstatement of U.S. sanctions against Iran.

Gaff&rsquo;s off-the-ball blow on Fremantle Dockers midfielder Andrew Brayshaw on Sunday knocked out several of the first-year player&rsquo;s teeth and brought a premature end to his campaign with three matches to play in the regular season. The incident sparked uproar in the Australian Rules football community and triggered calls for 26-year-old Gaff to be banned from the top flight for life. &ldquo;We will make an assessment on this incident as we would with other matters of public interest, and we would encourage any parties directly connected and concerned with this matter to contact WA Police Force,&rdquo; Western Australia state police commissioner Chris Dawson told reporters in Kalgoorlie. &ldquo;No one likes to see hits like that in competitive sport. &ldquo;It is rare for police to lay criminal charges as a result of an incident in a professional competitive sporting event. &ldquo;Physical contact on the footy field is expected. The central issue here is what should be governed by the sporting code and what falls within the criminal realm.&rdquo; Brayshaw, whose brother Hamish is on the playing roster of Perth-based West Coast, came off the ground with blood streaming from his mouth and underwent surgery at a local hospital to repair his jaw and replace three teeth. He would not be able to eat solid foods for a month, his club said. Gaff, who previously had a spotless disciplinary record, apologized to Brayshaw in a post-match television interview, saying he felt &ldquo;sick&rdquo; over the incident. His club CEO Trevor Nisbett said he had personally apologized to the Brayshaw family but bristled over calls by a prominent Perth lawyer for Gaff to be charged with assault.  &ldquo;Some of those inflammatory comments by some people just are unwarranted, because everyone knows we&rsquo;ve got a process in the AFL and the club will take the process to the tribunal,&rdquo; Nisbett told reporters in Perth. &ldquo;The AFL will deal with it. The player will get the penalty that the AFL tribunal deems as deserved in this case.&rdquo; AFL players are regularly suspended for multiple games by the league&rsquo;s disciplinary tribunal for head-high punches but police have only charged one since the formerly Victoria state-based league expanded into a national competition in the 1980s. Hawthorn Hawk Leigh Matthews, one of the game&rsquo;s most revered players, was convicted and fined A$1,000 ($740) after being charged with assault for breaking a Geelong opponent&rsquo;s jaw in a 1985 match. The conviction was overturned on appeal.

But Credit Suisse said it believes the sterling price of oil has peaked and the boost provided by a weaker currency to internationally-exposed UK-listed firms might be over as the country&rsquo;s economic growth outlook stabilizes and a soft Brexit is likely.  &ldquo;The UK market is now overbought: The equity market underperforms 70 percent of the time this happens,&rdquo; analysts at the Swiss bank said in a note on Monday.

Maeri, another North Korean website, stressed the need for U.S. action to build confidence in response to the North&rsquo;s moves to end weapons program and send back the remains.  &ldquo;It takes two to tango,&rdquo; it said.  Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for South Korea&rsquo;s presidential Blue House, said on Monday the government was asking the North to hasten denuclearisation and the United States to show sincerity over the North&rsquo;s demands for reciprocal steps.

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said the death toll was expected to rise as information came in from areas where thousands of buildings collapsed or were badly damaged, especially in the north, the quake&rsquo;s epicenter. Power and communications were cut in some areas of Lombok, and the military said it was sending in a vessel with medical aid, supplies and logistical support for the island. The Indonesian Red Cross said in a Tweet that it helped a woman give birth after the quake at a health post in the north. One of the names she gave the baby boy was &lsquo;Gempa&rsquo;, which means earthquake.     Lombok was hit a week earlier, on July 29, by a 6.4 magnitude quake that killed 17 people, injured hundreds and briefly stranded several hundred trekkers on the slopes of a volcano.  The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) said that more than 120 aftershocks were recorded after Sunday evening&rsquo;s quake, whose magnitude the U.S. Geological Survey revised down to 6.9 from an original 7.0. There were no foreigners among the dead and the number of injured stood at 209, BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference. The tremor was so powerful it was felt on the neighboring island of Bali where, according to BNPB, two people died. Indonesia sits on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. &ldquo;THIS IS IT FOR ME IN INDONESIA&rdquo; Long lines formed at the airport of Lombok&rsquo;s main town, Mataram, as foreign visitors cut their holidays short. The Garuda Indonesia airline said it was adding extra flights from Lombok to help tourists leave. AirAsia Group CEO Tony Fernandes tweeted that the budget airline would try to lay on extra flights, while Indonesian budget carriers Lion Air and Citilink said there had been a jump in demand for outbound flights from Lombok and Bali. &ldquo;I was at the rooftop of my hotel and the building started swaying very hard. It felt like two meters to the left, then two meters to the right, I could not stand up,&rdquo; said Gino Poggiali, a 43-year-old Frenchman, who was with his wife and two children, at the Lombok airport. His wife Maude, 44, said the family were on Bali for the first quake and Lombok for the second. &ldquo;This is it for me in Indonesia,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Next time we will stay in France or somewhere close.&rdquo; Carlos Romartinez, a 24-year-old Spaniard who was also waiting for a flight out of Lombok, said he had decided to head instead to the island of Flores to the east.  &ldquo;All the activities are shut down.

He posted a video showing a crowd of hundreds of people crammed on a beach at one of the Gilis, apparently waiting to be ferried back to the main island. Singapore Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who was on the 10th floor of a hotel in Mataram when the quake struck, said that his room shook violently and walls cracked. &ldquo;It was quite impossible to stand up. Heard screams. Came out, and made my way down a staircase, while building was still shaking. Power went out for a while. Lots of cracks, fallen doors,&rdquo; he wrote on Facebook.

The planned combination in an all-shares merger, agreed in principle in December 2016, would create a global leader in gas distribution ahead of France&rsquo;s Air Liquide (AIRP.PA ). But the companies agreed at the time that if regulators demanded the disposal of businesses with more than 3.7 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in sales or 1.1 billion euros in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), either party could withdraw without penalty. Linde said on Sunday it was informed that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission had &ldquo;expressed expectations with regards to further divestiture commitments and prospective purchasers which are considered required for a merger clearance,&rdquo; it said. Based on its discussions with the FTC and other antitrust regulators, it said there was now a higher probability that the two companies would need to commit to selling assets exceeding the agreed threshold. The two companies are now evaluating how the regulators&rsquo; expectations could be fulfilled in a mutually acceptable manner to achieve a timely clearance of the planned merger, it said, adding they remained in a constructive dialogue with the regulators and with each other. Reuters reported last month that the European Commission was set to give its blessing to the tie-up after an in-depth antitrust review and following the agreed sale of Praxair&rsquo;s European gases business to Japanese rival Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp (4091.T ). In addition, Linde agreed to sell North and South American assets to a consortium of German gases firm Messer and buyout group CVC in a deal that will raise around $3.3 billion.

The trade dispute with the United States, rising corporate borrowing costs, and a steep decline in the value of the yuan versus the dollar have raised concerns that the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy could face a steeper slowdown. Chinese banks were estimated to have doled out 1.2 trillion yuan ($175.4 billion) in new yuan loans in July, easing from a five-month high of 1.84 trillion yuan in June, according to a Reuters survey of 36 analysts. But the expected July tally looks solid comparing to 825.5 billion yuan a year earlier. Chinese banks usually make few loans in July after traditionally ramping up lending in June. Broad M2 money supply was seen rising 8.2 percent in July from a year earlier, accelerating from June&rsquo;s 8 percent rise, which was the lowest on record, according to the poll. Annual growth of outstanding loans was seen quickening to 12.8 percent in July from 12.7 percent in June. The People&rsquo;s Bank of China (PBOC) has been pumping out more cash to encourage bank lending but it faces difficulty in channeling credit to small firms, which are vital for economic growth and job creation, analysts said. State banks remain reluctant to lend to small firms, which are considered riskier than state-controlled firms. The PBOC has cut banks&rsquo; reserve requirements three times this year, with the latest reduction on July 5 freeing up 700 billion yuan in liquidity. It also lent a net 905.5 billion yuan to financial institutions via its medium-term lending facility (MLF) in June and July, central bank data showed. CRACKDOWN ON SHADOW LOANS A central bank adviser said last week China should limit the credit impact of its financial deleveraging drive, voicing concern that tightening may have gone too far. Annual growth in China&rsquo;s outstanding total social financing (TFS), which includes off-balance sheet forms of financing, slowed to 9.8 percent in June, the lowest on record, according to central bank data. Combined trust loans, entrusted loans and undiscounted bankers&rsquo; acceptances, which are common forms of shadow banking finance, shrank by 1.26 trillion yuan in the first six months, central bank data showed. Commercial firms remain reluctant to make loans to small firms, which are considered to be riskier than state-owned firms. China&rsquo;s economic growth slowed slightly to 6.7 percent in the second quarter and July factory surveys pointed to further slowing in activity. Policy advisers have said that Beijing plans to put more money into infrastructure projects and ease borrowing curbs on local governments to support the slowing economy. China&rsquo;s central bank is due to release July lending and money supply data between August 10 and 15.

Falls in HSBC (HSBA.L ) and Banco BPM (BAMI.MI ) following their results dragged the banking sector .SX7P down, while chemicals and industrials shares also weighed on the pan-European STOXX 600, down 0.1 percent by 0830 GMT.  HSBC shares fell 1.1 percent after it reported disappointing earnings due to rising expenses from investments in a new growth strategy and a $765 million provision against sale of U.S. mortgage securities. &ldquo;On revenues, we note on the positive side that loan growth continues to be very strong,&rdquo; Goldman Sachs analysts said. &ldquo;On the negative side, we note that the group has lowered its expected net interest income sensitivity to U.S.$ rates.&rdquo; Banco BPM shares fell 8.6 percent after the Italian lender&rsquo;s earnings missed forecasts due to higher than expected loan loss provisions, and its capital buffer suffered due to sharp falls in Italian government bonds during May&rsquo;s political upheaval. &ldquo;CET1 (core equity tier 1) fell 67 basis points quarter-on-quarter to 10.83%, with the expected BTP headwind exacerbated by the lack of room to absorb additional DTAs (deferred tax assets) and reduced thresholds,&rdquo; said UBS analysts. Overall Europe&rsquo;s banks have performed quite well in the second-quarter earnings season, with stronger than expected earnings growth and profitability.   M&A disappointments hit some shares hard.  Linde (LIN1.DE ) sank 9.1 percent to a 3-1\/2 month low after it said regulators may ask it and its U.S. rival Praxair to sell more assets in order to get antitrust approval for their merger. &ldquo;The probability for the merger has decreased,&rdquo; said Baader Helvea analysts, adding however they still believe it will close successfully. The heavyweight stock dragged Germany&rsquo;s DAX down to underperform peers, declining 0.2 percent. Linde also pulled the chemicals sector index .SX4P down 1.3 percent. Germany also suffered the biggest drop in industrial orders in 1-1\/2 years, driving industrial giants Siemens (SIEGn.DE ) and Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE ) down 0.8 to 0.9 percent. British serviced offices group IWG (IWG.L ) also suffered from M&A pain, sinking 21 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after the firm ended takeover talks with private equity firms Terra Firma, TDR and Starwood. Among gainers, Finnish refiner Neste (NESTE.HE ) rose 4 percent, recovering from Friday&rsquo;s fall after results. Brokers Inderes and Kepler Cheuvreux raised their target prices on the stock.  A target price hike from Morgan Stanley also boosted Galapagos (GLPG.AS ) shares up 4.5 percent.  A downgrade to &ldquo;hold&rdquo; from HSBC analysts sent shares in German lighting group Osram Licht (OSRn.DE ) down 4.4 percent. The broker cut estimates to reflect lower growth and margins at the firm&rsquo;s Opto and Specialty Lighting. Overall second-quarter earnings for MSCI Europe firms are expected to grow 7.8 percent year-on-year in euro terms, while they&rsquo;re seen growing 2.5 percent year-on-year for MSCI EMU.  Europe remains an unpopular region for stocks investors, though some indicated the outflows could turn soon as companies deliver good results and analysts revise their earnings expectations up.  &ldquo;European outflows already look excessive at -$36bn over the last 12 months,&rdquo; Citi strategists said.

In late June, hackers started stealing personal details and prescription records of patients who visited Singapore&rsquo;s outpatient clinics over the previous three years, authorities announced on July 20. Speaking in parliament on Monday, S. Iswaran said the government would not disclose the attackers&rsquo; identity for security reasons but had determined the attack was the work of an &lsquo;Advanced Persistent Threat&rsquo; group which is typically state-linked. &ldquo;This (APT) refers to a class of sophisticated cyber attackers, typically state-linked, who conduct extended, carefully planned cyber campaigns, to steal information or disrupt operations,&rdquo; said Iswaran, Singapore&rsquo;s minister for communications and information. Iswaran said government agencies had a high level of confidence in the identity of the attackers but not enough evidence to take legal action. Health minister Gan Kim Yong added that the attackers had made efforts to remove their tracks, making investigations harder, and that they could strike again. &ldquo;Despite our security measures, the attackers had been very patient, very persistent and very resourceful,&rdquo; said Gan. &ldquo;With advanced hacking tools, they eventually succeeded... We take this seriously as there&rsquo;s no reason to believe that they will not try again with even more advanced tools.&rdquo; In the wake of the attack, the government disconnected computers from the internet at public healthcare centers and set up a four-member panel to investigate the incident which will report by the end of December. Professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore are working with the health ministry to identify vulnerabilities in their systems and plug any holes to try and prevent a repeat, Gan added. Major cyber attacks are rare in Singapore, which has invested heavily in cyber security over the past decade. The attack comes as the highly wired and digitalized state has made cyber security a priority both at home and for its neighbors in the ASEAN regional bloc.

Sales at the unit grew 4.6 percent in the quarter to June, with profit up 0.7 percent. Son has previously said a second Vision Fund is coming, but on Monday declined to be drawn on its timing and size. Profit for the three months through June was 715 billion yen ($6.42 billion) from 479 billion yen a year earlier, SoftBank said. SoftBank did not release a forecast for the current business year, saying there were too many uncertain factors.

In late June, hackers started stealing personal details and prescription records of patients who visited Singapore&rsquo;s outpatient clinics over the previous three years, authorities announced on July 20. Speaking in parliament on Monday, S. Iswaran said the government would not disclose the attackers&rsquo; identity for security reasons but had determined the attack was the work of an &lsquo;Advanced Persistent Threat&rsquo; group which is typically state-linked. &ldquo;This (APT) refers to a class of sophisticated cyber attackers, typically state-linked, who conduct extended, carefully planned cyber campaigns, to steal information or disrupt operations,&rdquo; said Iswaran, Singapore&rsquo;s minister for communications and information. Iswaran said government agencies had a high level of confidence in the identity of the attackers but not enough evidence to take legal action. Health minister Gan Kim Yong added that the attackers had made efforts to remove their tracks, making investigations harder, and that they could strike again. &ldquo;Despite our security measures, the attackers had been very patient, very persistent and very resourceful,&rdquo; said Gan. &ldquo;With advanced hacking tools, they eventually succeeded... We take this seriously as there&rsquo;s no reason to believe that they will not try again with even more advanced tools.&rdquo; In the wake of the attack, the government disconnected computers from the internet at public healthcare centers and set up a four-member panel to investigate the incident which will report by the end of December. Professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) and the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore are working with the health ministry to identify vulnerabilities in their systems and plug any holes to try and prevent a repeat, Gan added. Major cyber attacks are rare in Singapore, which has invested heavily in cyber security over the past decade. The attack comes as the highly wired and digitalized state has made cyber security a priority both at home and for its neighbors in the ASEAN regional bloc.

The recount was ordered by parliament in June after a government report concluded there were serious violations in an initial count using an electronic vote-counting system. However, a fire that broke out in the warehouse where the  votes were stored had made a complete recount impossible, leading the electoral commission to cancel it the remaining half of the capital, the state broadcaster said. The commission&rsquo;s leadership had been suspended and replaced with a panel of judges who oversaw the recount. It is expected to announce its results in the coming days. The winning parties are currently embroiled in negotiations over forming the next governing coalition. Influential cleric Moqtada al-Sadr&rsquo;s bloc came first in the election, followed by a group of Iran-backed Shi&rsquo;ite militia leaders, with incumbent Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi&rsquo;s bloc in third place. The political uncertainty has fueled tensions at a time when public impatience is growing over poor basic services, unemployment and the slow pace of rebuilding after a three-year war with Islamic State which cost tens of billions of dollars.

(Reuters) - Lawyers for Paul Manafort, the former campaign chairman for U.S. President Donald Trump, will face a major test on Monday when they cross-examine an accountant who testified that she helped Manafort to prepare fraudulent tax returns. The jury in the Alexandria, Virginia, trial heard testimony on Friday from Cynthia Laporta, who described how Manafort and longtime business associate Rick Gates doctored financial statements and backdated loans. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. The charges largely predate his five months on the Trump campaign.   Since the trial started on Tuesday, Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers have kept their cross-examinations brief and at times shied from addressing seemingly damaging testimony in detail. But Laporta&rsquo;s testimony raised the stakes for Manafort, legal experts said. Testifying under immunity, she was the first witness to admit she knew accounting maneuvers Manafort and Gates requested of her were wrong and could be crimes. One accounting trick saved Manafort $500,000 in taxes, she said.  David Axelrod, a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense attorney, said Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers need to hammer home that Laporta received immunity for providing potentially incriminating evidence against Manafort, and highlight her own admission that she went along with the accounting for fear of losing a lucrative client, an acknowledgement she lied for money.   &ldquo;You make her say &lsquo;I lied&rsquo; as many times as you can,&rdquo; Axelrod said. Judge T.S. Ellis told Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers on Friday they could dig into Laporta&rsquo;s immunity agreement on cross. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re entitled to go into that in any detail you want to,&rdquo; he said. Laporta was the 14th witness called by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose case against Manafort arose out of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. The charges against Manafort do not address collusion, although a second trial set for September in Washington could reveal new information on that issue.   Contradicting earlier statements, Trump acknowledged on Sunday that his son met with Russians in 2016 at Trump Tower to get information on election opponent Hillary Clinton. Manafort also attended the meeting, along with other campaign aides. SEPARATING GATES  Laporta detailed multiple examples in which Manafort and Gates sought to doctor financial records, first in order to lower Manafort&rsquo;s taxable income and then later to inflate his income so that he could get bank loans. Some of the maneuvers were at the request of Gates, while others implicated Manafort, Laporta testified. In one instance Manafort&rsquo;s signature was on a loan agreement created in 2015 and inappropriately backdated for the 2014 tax year, she said. Similar to prior witnesses, Laporta testified that Gates and Manafort were in lockstep but that Manafort was in charge. Shanlon Wu, a\u00a0former attorney for Gates before he pleaded guilty in February and starting cooperating with Mueller, said Monday would be a critical test of the defense&rsquo;s strategy of pinning the wrongdoing on Gates. &ldquo;They must make headway in separating Gates and Manafort,&rdquo; Wu said. Wu said he was speaking as an observer now that he is no longer involved in the case. Laporta was one of five witnesses granted immunity for the trial. The other four include an insurance agent, two bankers who worked on mortgages for Manafort, and Conor O&rsquo;Brien, a former assistant to Laporta at the accounting firm KWC. Given the impact of Laporta&rsquo;s testimony, it is now unlikely the prosecution will call O&rsquo;Brien to the stand, according to a person close to the case. That could change if Laporta&rsquo;s credibility is undermined on cross, the person said. While taking some of the sting out of Laporta&rsquo;s testimony could prove useful to the defense, the more important challenge will be undercutting Gates, who as part of his plea deal admitted to helping Manafort evade taxes and mislead banks to get him loans. Gates said he did so at Manafort&rsquo;s direction. Gates is expected to testify this week.  &ldquo;The real fireworks are going to come when Mr. Gates is on the stand and is crossed,&rdquo; said J.

They were convicted of &ldquo;deliberate violation of state regulations on economic management, causing serious consequences&rdquo; at the end of a two-week trial by a court in Ho Chi Minh City, the ministry said on its official website. &ldquo;The violations of Danh and his accomplices caused damage of 6.1 trillion dong to the Vietnam Construction Bank, leaving adverse impacts on the banking system,&rdquo; the VnExpress online newspaper cited the jury as saying. The figure is equivalent to nearly $262 million.  The court also sentenced Tram Be, former deputy chairman of Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint Stock Bank, to four years in prison on the same charges, police said in the statement. Terms ranging from two years of probation to 10 years in prison were also handed to 43 accomplices, it added.  Danh, 53, was sentenced in 2016 to 30 years in prison in a separate trial, accused of illegally withdrawing more than $400 million from the bank. Authorities have since stepped up their graft crackdown, leading to the arrests of dozens of high-profile business figures and officials. Last month, a former deputy governor of the central bank was jailed for three years, the most senior banking official put on trial in the crackdown. Dang Thanh Binh, 64, and four accomplices were accused of &ldquo;lack of responsibility&rdquo;, leading to losses at Vietnam Construction Bank.

The fire, which started on Friday, grew over the weekend during a heatwave sweeping large parts of Europe.  Temperatures have started to fall from the peak of nearly 47 degrees Celsius, but it remains very hot in most of the country. Emergency services added a further 350 firefighters to combat the flames overnight. A helicopter drops water on a fire near small village of Monchique, Portugal August 6, 2018.

People were evacuated from the area but Joao Furtado, 60, was forced to hide in a water tank to escape the flames as his house burned down, according to his sister-in-law. &ldquo;He was panicking because he was trapped in the house,&rdquo; said Maria Helena Furtado. &ldquo;There was fire everywhere and he couldn&rsquo;t get out.&rdquo; Civil protection authorities said smoke was making it difficult for firefighting planes to access the area but nine helicopters were flying. There were 350 fire engines involved in the effort. A helicopter drops water on a fire near small village of Monchique, Portugal August 6, 2018.

The incident failed to generate any wave of spontaneous support from traditional government backers, many of whom are reeling from hyperinflation, frequent water and power cuts, and food shortages.

Last year, a rogue Venezuelan police officer hijacked a helicopter and fired at government buildings in what he said was an action against a dictator. The officer was hunted down and killed by Venezuelan forces. But in public, the top brass remains fiercely loyal to Maduro, a 55-year-old former bus driver and union leader who unlike his predecessor Hugo Chavez does not hail from the military.

In parallel to U.N. mediation, Egypt has used its contacts with both Israel and the dominant Palestinian Islamist group Hamas to discuss ways of calming a more than three-month-old surge in confrontations along the Gaza-Israel border. But some Egyptian officials say they would resist any attempt by Israel, or its U.S. ally, to shift to Cairo the onus for addressing Gaza&rsquo;s long-term governance or economic problems.  Egypt ruled Gaza before losing it to Israel in a 1967 war.    Israel withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 while keeping control of its coast and airspace. Egypt has helped the Israelis isolate Hamas while insisting they remain the occupiers of Palestinian territory and therefore uniquely liable for Gaza.  Asked about Cairo&rsquo;s role in the truce talks, Zeev Elkin, a member of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&rsquo;s security cabinet and Likud party, said Egyptian security needs meant the Arab power &ldquo;understands that it cannot shrug off Gaza&rdquo;.   &ldquo;As far as we are concerned, after the State of Israel left Gaza, responsibility should not be imposed on us. Egypt is no less responsible,&rdquo; Elkin to Israel&rsquo;s Ynet TV in an interview. &ldquo;We left Gaza. If someone strikes at us from Gaza, they will get hit back. Let the Arab world resolve the internal, humanitarian problem of the Gaza Strip. Why should we bear responsibility for this?&rdquo;  Asked if Elkin&rsquo;s comments reflected Netanyahu government policy, an Israeli official close to the prime minister declined comment. There was no immediate response from Cairo. DIPLOMAT MESSAGING But Egyptian officials have privately voiced worry about Israeli calls for them to be more involved in Gaza, proposals that they think may dovetail with the Trump administration&rsquo;s efforts to address Palestinian grievances with pan-Arab help.  According to one Egyptian official, the Foreign Ministry in Cairo instructed its diplomats in a June 10 cable to emphasize that Egypt would not budge from its position that Israel is the country with exclusive, ultimate responsibility for Gaza.  A ministry spokesman was not immediately available to respond to a request for comment on the cable. The Egyptian official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, summarized Cairo&rsquo;s message as: &ldquo;We are willing to do what we can to calm down the situation in Gaza or work on Palestinian reconciliation. But we will not take over from Israel in Gaza. It&rsquo;s Israel&rsquo;s problem.&rdquo; The Palestinians and the United Nations similarly dispute Israel&rsquo;s assertion that it ended its occupation of Gaza in 2005. On Sunday, when the Israeli security cabinet convened to discuss the Gaza truce ideas, one member - Intelligence Minister Israel Katz - tweeted that these should include &ldquo;bringing Egyptian infrastructure, at sea and on land, to bear for the good for Gaza, under international supervision&rdquo;.  The Egyptian official said Cairo would not let its facilities or territory in the Sinai desert, bordering Gaza, be used to relieve Israel of keeping the Palestinian economy alive. Still, in what Palestinians saw a goodwill gesture, Egyptian cooking oil began entering Gaza on Sunday, offsetting Israeli supplies cut off in retaliation for the border violence. The White House said on June 21 that it had discussed with Egypt &ldquo;the need to facilitate humanitarian relief to Gaza&rdquo;. The Trump administration&rsquo;s stated position is that Gaza should be under the control of Hamas&rsquo;s Western-backed Palestinian rivals.

The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said it expected the death toll to rise once the rubble of more than 13,000 flattened and damaged houses was cleared away. Power and communications were severed in some areas, with landslides and a collapsed bridge blocking access to areas around the quake epicenter in the north. The military said it would send a ship with medical aid, supplies and logistics support.

Lombok was hit on July 29 by a 6.4 magnitude quake that killed 17 people and briefly stranded several hundred trekkers on the slopes of a volcano. The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) said more than 120 aftershocks were recorded after Sunday evening&rsquo;s quake, whose magnitude the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) revised down to 6.9 from an initial 7.0. At that magnitude it released more than five times the energy of the quake a week earlier, the USGS website showed. The dead included no foreigners and there were 236 people injured, BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.

The first quake was also felt on Bali. Indonesia sits on the geologically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. Nugroho said more than 20,000 people had been displaced.

The main hospital in the town of Tanjung in the north was severely damaged, so staff set up about 30 beds in the shade of trees and in a tent on a field to tend to the injured. A boy with a heavily bandaged leg wailed in pain, an  elderly man wore a splint improvised from cardboard strips of cardboard on a broken arm, and some hurt by falling debris still had dried blood on their faces. &ldquo;THIS IS IT FOR ME INDONESIA&rdquo; Sengiggi, a seaside tourist strip on Lombok, wore an abandoned look.

The recount was ordered by parliament in June after a government report concluded there were serious violations in an initial count using an electronic vote-counting system. However, a fire that broke out in the warehouse where the  votes were stored had made a complete recount impossible, leading the electoral commission to cancel it the remaining half of the capital, the state broadcaster said. The commission&rsquo;s leadership had been suspended and replaced with a panel of judges who oversaw the recount. It is expected to announce its results in the coming days. The winning parties are currently embroiled in negotiations over forming the next governing coalition. Influential cleric Moqtada al-Sadr&rsquo;s bloc came first in the election, followed by a group of Iran-backed Shi&rsquo;ite militia leaders, with incumbent Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi&rsquo;s bloc in third place. The political uncertainty has fueled tensions at a time when public impatience is growing over poor basic services, unemployment and the slow pace of rebuilding after a three-year war with Islamic State which cost tens of billions of dollars.

The midsize Avancier is produced and sold in the world&rsquo;s biggest auto market by one of Honda&rsquo;s two local joint ventures. Honda said it was looking at two other models in China to see if they were facing the same problem. The recall is linked to a problem caused by an unusual amount of un-combusted petrol collecting in the engine&rsquo;s lubricant oil pan. The issue in some cases caused a strong odor of gasoline inside the car and in other cases the car&rsquo;s check-engine light came on, Honda has said. This does not affect the engine&rsquo;s performance and there have been no reports of accidents because of this particular issue, the automaker added. Earlier this year, the cold-climate engine issue prompted the Tokyo-headquartered automaker to recall 130,000 of its popular CR-V SUV models and 294,500 Civic cars in China. The company is currently studying to see if the same issue is affecting the Honda Jade car and the UR-V crossover SUV, Honda spokesman Zhu Linjie said. &ldquo;If it is so determined that these models are also being affected by the same engine issue, Honda will announce measures to deal with it,&rdquo; Zhu told Reuters. The quality issue has led to a slump in Honda&rsquo;s business in the country. Its sales fell for a sixth straight month in July, down 7.8 percent from a year earlier to 105,960 vehicles.  During the first seven months of 2018, Honda&rsquo;s sales volume in China fell 6.6 percent from a year ago to 715,060 vehicles.

The midsize Avancier is produced and sold in the world&rsquo;s biggest auto market by one of Honda&rsquo;s two local joint ventures. Honda said it was looking at two other models in China to see if they were facing the same problem. The recall is linked to a problem caused by an unusual amount of un-combusted petrol collecting in the engine&rsquo;s lubricant oil pan. The issue in some cases caused a strong odor of gasoline inside the car and in other cases the car&rsquo;s check-engine light came on, Honda has said. This does not affect the engine&rsquo;s performance and there have been no reports of accidents because of this particular issue, the automaker added. Earlier this year, the cold-climate engine issue prompted the Tokyo-headquartered automaker to recall 130,000 of its popular CR-V SUV models and 294,500 Civic cars in China. The company is currently studying to see if the same issue is affecting the Honda Jade car and the UR-V crossover SUV, Honda spokesman Zhu Linjie said. &ldquo;If it is so determined that these models are also being affected by the same engine issue, Honda will announce measures to deal with it,&rdquo; Zhu told Reuters. The quality issue has led to a slump in Honda&rsquo;s business in the country. Its sales fell for a sixth straight month in July, down 7.8 percent from a year earlier to 105,960 vehicles.  During the first seven months of 2018, Honda&rsquo;s sales volume in China fell 6.6 percent from a year ago to 715,060 vehicles.

Named the &ldquo;chef of the century&rdquo; by the Gault et Millau cooking guide in 1990, Robuchon was regarded as a perfectionist, toiling to make even ordinary seeming dishes \u2014 such as mashed potatoes \u2014 the very best they could be. He came into his own in the 1980s and early 1990s, when gourmet food went global. He steadily expanded his renown, from being one of Paris&rsquo;s most recognized three-star chefs to become a worldwide phenomenon. In France, Robuchon is regarded as a chef who ushered in an era of authenticity after the restraint of nouvelle cuisine. &ldquo;The older I get, the more I realize the truth is: the simpler the food, the more exception it can be,&rdquo; he told Business Insider in an interview in 2014. &ldquo;I never try to marry more than three flavors in one dish. I like walking into a kitchen and knowing that the dishes are identifiable and the ingredients within them easy to detect.&rdquo; Born in Poitiers, western France, in 1945, Robuchon rose quickly through apprenticeships, learning techniques from across the country, before taking over as head chef of what was then the Hotel Concorde La Fayette in Paris at the age of 29. As with many other star chefs, his brand eventually became a business in itself and he opened restaurants from Las Vegas to Shanghai, Bangkok, Macau, Tokyo and New York.  In June this year, his company closed its two restaurants in Singapore, with five Michelin stars between them.

Markets also anticipated an announcement from Washington later on Monday on renewed U.S. sanctions against major oil exporter Iran. So-called &ldquo;snapback&rdquo; sanctions are due to be reinstated at 12:01 a.m. EDT (8.01 a.m. ET) on Tuesday, according to a U.S. Treasury official. Saudi Arabia pumped around 10.29 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July, two OPEC sources said on Friday, down about 200,000 bpd from a month earlier.  That came despite a pledge by the Saudis and top producer Russia in June to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia promising a &ldquo;measurable&rdquo; supply boost.

This is not about bombarding the market with oil and pushing the price into the $50s, it is about preparing the market and easing the transition, he said. &ldquo;There is no wish from Saudi Arabia to push prices down to $50.&rdquo; Most Iranian crude exports go to China and India, but roughly 20 percent go to Europe, where refiners have already cut their purchases. Saudi Arabia last week cut its official selling prices for Asian customers to a four-month low. [OSP\/O] U.S. investment bank Jefferies said in a note that &ldquo;the Saudi and Russian production surges appear to be more limited&rdquo; than initially expected, adding that bullish market sentiment was also fueled by the imminent reinstatement of U.S. sanctions against Iran. Still, with Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia now all producing 10 million to 11 million bpd of crude, just three countries now meet around a third of global oil demand. Meanwhile, U.S. energy companies last week cut oil rigs for a second time in the past three weeks as the rate of growth has slowed over the past couple of months. Drillers cut two oil rigs in the week to Aug. 3, bringing the total count down to 859, Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday.

The legal move is the latest step in a 14-year-old trade dispute between the EU and the United States over funding for Airbus (AIR.PA ) and its U.S. rival Boeing. (BA.N )   In May the WTO appeals body ruled that the EU had failed to remove subsidized government development loans for the world&rsquo;s largest airliner, the A380, and Europe&rsquo;s newest long-haul jet, the A350, causing losses for Boeing BA.N and U.S. aerospace workers.

SoftBank, which is planning to list its domestic telecoms business, also said profit was bolstered by the sale of most of the Chinese operations of chip design unit ARM Holdings. The sales are the first signs of SoftBank monetizing its investments after pumping billions of dollars into technology companies around the world yet taking little profit. Its Vision Fund is the world&rsquo;s largest private equity fund, raising over $93 billion at its first major close in May last year.

Its investments are now worth $32.5 billion on the rising value of its various stakes, such as in shared office space company WeWork Cos.

Against a broad basket of currencies .DXY, the dollar rose a third of a percent to 95.451 and is within striking distance of more-than-one-year peak of 95.652 reached on July 19. &ldquo;The U.S. economy is doing well and the Fed is moving towards a more predictable path of interest rates than earlier which has prompted us to change our underweight positions on U.S. debt to neutral in some portfolios,&rdquo; said Paul Eitelman, a senior investment specialist at Russell Investments. The dollar&rsquo;s gains has been more pronounced against emerging-market currencies as investors bet that an escalation in trade war concerns would hit these export-oriented economies harder. Since mid-April, the dollar index .DXY has gained 6 percent while an emerging-market local currency bond exchange traded fund (LEMB.K ) has fallen more than 10 percent over the same period. The dollar gained against emerging-market currencies, including the Turkish lira, which weakened 0.6 percent to a record low of 5.12 to the dollar. The United States announced late on Friday it was reviewing Turkey&rsquo;s duty-free access to U.S. markets \u2013 a move that could affect nearly $1.7 billion of Turkish imports. Chinese stocks .SSEC slumped nearly 2 percent as Beijing proposed tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods on Friday, while a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks with Washington to resolve the conflict. DEFENSIVE BIDS With Friday&rsquo;s U.S. jobs data broadly indicative of a strong economy and July inflation data due later this week, markets are primed for a further increase in U.S. Treasury yields, which should support the dollar. Inflation data this week should support that trend. ING strategists believe a report later this week will show that U.S. inflation has reached 3 percent, indicative of a strong economy. A Reuters poll predicts a similar increase. That has also prompted hedge funds to only slightly trim their dollar long positions this week with overall bets still at their biggest in more than a year and a half. &ldquo;In currencies, we have seen defensive currencies like the U.S. dollar strengthen,&rdquo; said James Bateman, CIO of the multi-asset strategy team at Fidelity Investments.  &ldquo;While the consensus view may be that we&rsquo;ve had a bit of a slowdown but things are stabilizing, it is equally possible that these are early cracks in the ice.&rdquo; Currency markets remained cautious, with high-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar AUD=D3 on the back foot. China&rsquo;s central bank said it would set a reserve requirement ratio of 20 percent from Monday on financial institutions settling foreign exchange forward dollar sales to clients, effectively raising the cost for investors of betting against the yuan. Britain&rsquo;s pound sank to an 11-month low as comments by officials about a no-deal Brexit stoked fears Britain would crash out of the European Union without securing a trade agreement. Elsewhere, the euro EUR=EBS held at a five-week low of $1.1533 as German industrial orders fell more than expected in June, posting their steepest monthly drop in nearly a year and a half.

Video clips circulating on Chinese social media earlier on Monday showed people gathering outside the regulator&rsquo;s offices being taken away on buses by police.  Some of those taken away were heard on the clips identifying themselves as investors in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms that could not pay them back.   Reuters could not independently verify the video clips, and the banking regulator could not be immediately reached outside business hours for comment.   P2P platforms collect funds from investors promising attractive returns. The funds are in turn offered to borrowers traditionally not served by risk-averse banks.  The number of online P2P platforms has shrunk dramatically in recent years as Beijing has cracked down on risky lending practices in a broader deleveraging campaign.  Ezubao, once China&rsquo;s biggest P2P lending platform, folded in 2016 after it turned out to be a Ponzi scheme that collected 59.8 billion yuan ($8.7 billion) from more than 900,000 investors through savvy marketing. By the time police made arrests in early 2016, the company had failed to repay 38 billion yuan.

The world has distanced itself from their hostile policies against Iran.&rdquo; A first round of U.S. sanctions against Iran, lifted under the 2015 international deal over its nuclear program, are due to be reinstated on Tuesday. They will cover Iran&rsquo;s purchases of dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals and its automotive sector. Under the deal between Tehran and world powers, most international sanctions imposed on Iran were lifted in 2016 in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.  Saying the deal had failed to address Iran&rsquo;s ballistic missile program, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 and its role in regional wars, Trump withdrew from it in May in a move that Israel - which Iran refuses to recognize - and Saudi Arabia welcomed. Israel supported the imminent resumption of U.S. sanctions. They &ldquo;will compel the Iranians to decide between meeting the demands of the United States ... or risking the regime&rsquo;s collapse and fall. The first option is good, the second excellent,&rdquo; Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz said on Twitter. Shi&rsquo;ite Iran has also been at loggerheads for decades with Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, fighting a long-running proxy war in the Middle East and beyond that has influenced conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. &ldquo;These three countries want to create psychological tension against Iran ... We will overcome this period of hardship,&rdquo; Zarif said.    Despite efforts by Russia, China and Europe to salvage the deal, the Trump administration is pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November, when the United States reimposes sanctions Iran&rsquo;s oil and shipping industries.  Fear of sanctions and economic hardship have led to sporadic protests in several cities in Iran in the past days, with ordinary Iranians chanting slogans against Iranian leaders.

Despite protest from European allies, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo vowed to fully enforce the snapback of sanctions, whose implementation will be detailed by the U.S. administration on Monday. The EU and other parties to the deal, China and Russia, are working to maintain trade with Iran, which has threatened to stop complying with curbs on its nuclear work if it fails to see the economic benefits of relief from sanctions under the deal. One EU measure to mitigate the impact of U.S. sanctions, known as the blocking statute, will come into force on Tuesday.  &ldquo;We deeply regret the re-imposition of sanctions by the U.S.,&rdquo; the bloc said in a joint statement with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Britain. &ldquo;The remaining parties ... have committed to work on, inter alia, the preservation and maintenance of effective financial channels with Iran, and the continuation of Iran&rsquo;s export of oil and gas.&rdquo; The EU&rsquo;s so-called blocking statute seeks to shield small and medium-sized businesses working in Iran. It seeks to forbid EU persons from complying with U.S. sanctions, allow for the recovery of related damages and counter court rulings to enforce American penalties.  EU officials admit, however, that the measure does not go far enough in protecting big European firms from the risks of investing in Iran.

Since war broke out in 2013, tens of thousands of people have been killed, a third of the population has fled their homes and the economy, which depends on oil, has been ruined. On Sunday President Salva Kiir and his former vice president turned rebel leader Riek Machar signed a ceasefire and power-sharing agreement in the Sudanese capital Khartoum. [L5N1UW0KB] Previous deals have failed to end the conflict and residents of the capital, Juba, said they are desperate for this one to succeed. &ldquo;What people want is services. People want peace. People want their children to go to school. (They want) hospitals and security and clean water. These are things now citizens are hoping for from our leaders,&rdquo; John Kenyi, 30, a\u00a0newspaper vendor in Juba, told Reuters.  Sarah Duku, a 38-year-old\u00a0mother of three, said: &ldquo;We hope that the parties come back to South Sudan and implement it this time ...As the mothers of this country we need peace so that our economy can improve.&rdquo; Sudan&rsquo;s government on Sunday also said that oil would be pumped from South Sudan&rsquo;s Unity State through Sudan for export from Sept. 1. South Sudan gained independence in 2011 after a bitter struggle but just two years later conflict along ethnic lines erupted because of a dispute between Kiir and Machar. A 2015 peace deal briefly halted the fighting but fell apart after Machar returned to the capital the following year. Other such deals also failed. Kiir said last week the new peace mediated by Sudan and east African nations would hold because it was not imposed by outsiders and other deals had failed because of external pressure. Some smaller opposition groups say they doubt the new deal because it does not allocate power fairly. &ldquo;The people are tired even if you call them you want to recruit them to go for war, they won&rsquo;t. So the leaders are left alone and there is nothing they can do except to sign peace,&rdquo; said James Okuk, a political analyst and lecturer based in Juba.

Travel agents in the Chinese city say they have seen a surge of interest from across the country in recent weeks, boosting an already strong peak tourism season. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un&rsquo;s economic reform plans and warming ties between Pyongyang and its main backers in Beijing were behind the jump in activity, agents said. &ldquo;People who may have long been curious about seeing North Korea may think that now it is safer than ever,&rdquo; said tour guide Teng Yi, who returned from leading a tour to Pyongyang on Sunday. After meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on June 19, their third such summit since March, Kim spent the subsequent month inspecting factories and industrial projects along the Chinese border region. The unusually long trip, plus meetings with U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and South Korea&rsquo;s unification minister, underlined Kim&rsquo;s desire to rally support at home for his economic drive and convincing outsiders of his willingness to denuclearize.  A dip in visitors after a tour bus crash killed 32 Chinese nationals in April proved a mere blip. Half-day and one-day tours to the neighboring North Korean city of Sinuiju now book out within an hour of tickets being released, travel agents in Dandong say. Four-day tours, which take in the capital Pyongyang and the Panmunjom truce village are fully booked through to the end of August, despite increased capacity through more frequent trains and coaches. Tourism is one of the few remaining reliable sources of foreign income for North Korea, after the U.N. imposed sanctions targeting 90 percent of its $3 billion annual exports including commodities, textiles and seafood. China has not provided a breakdown of the number of tourists traveling to North Korea since 2013. The Korea Maritime Institute, a South Korean think-tank, estimates tourism generates $44 million a year for the isolated country, with Chinese tourists making up about 80 percent of all foreign visitors to the North. ONE-TRACK MIND At a plenary meeting of the ruling Workers&rsquo; Party central committee in April, Kim said the North would shift its national focus away from a &ldquo;two-track&rdquo; strategy of developing the economy in tandem with developing nuclear weapons, having successfully concluded the latter. The national focus, he said, would now solely be on developing the economy. Betting on Pyongyang&rsquo;s pledge to rebuild its economy, property speculators pushed up home prices in Dandong to such an extent that local authorities stepped in to impose purchase restrictions in May.  However, questions remain about Kim&rsquo;s willingness to give up his nuclear weapons program and whether he continues to develop missiles and nuclear material.  The unpredictability of Kim and the continued uncertainty since his meeting with Donald Trump in June has meant most traders and businesses in Dandong continue to hold out a pragmatic &lsquo;wait and see&rsquo; attitude. But those with a more optimistic bent in Dandong told Reuters they saw Kim&rsquo;s travels in the Chinese border region, including to the island of Hwanggumpyong, as a signal the long-dormant special economic zone marked out there between the two countries in 2011 could be revived if things progress well. The plans for Hwanggumpyong, adjacent to Dandong, were announced to much fanfare, but already stuttering progress was curtailed in 2013 when Kim executed his uncle Jang Song Thaek - a top official who handled most of the North&rsquo;s dealings with China. The value of new property developments in the Dandong New Zone, designed to feed the Hwanggumpyong joint economic zone, spiked by more than 30 percent immediately after Kim first announced his economic focus, but has since cooled slightly as the U.S. maintains pressure to keep sanctions in place. Sanctions have weighed on traders in Dandong who deal with North Korean coal and other heavy commodities, as well as factories and restaurants who employ cheaper North Korean labor. To attract tourists, many Dandong restaurants feature colorfully dressed North Korean waitresses as well as North Korean entertainers who perform for diners, mixing contemporary Chinese pop into their repertoire of traditional North Korean songs. While restaurant owners and staff say restrictions remain on bringing in North Korean workers on new long-term visas, some circumvent the ban by bringing in staff on short-term permits with different visa classifications. &ldquo;Chinese authorities turn a blind eye,&rdquo; said one restaurant owner requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

E-Minis for the S&P 500 ESc1 were little moved, slipping in and out of positive territory. Despite the better mood in European trading hours, the tariff conflict between the U.S. and China remains a live and dominant theme for markets.  &ldquo;In his latest Twitter tirades and his latest appearances in front of his supporters the U.S. president has indicated something akin to a &lsquo;strategy&rsquo; behind his trade war policy,&rdquo; Commerzbank said. &ldquo;The trade war will remain in place regardless of how much the Chinese cave in.&rdquo; China proposed tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods on Friday and a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks to resolve the row. Trump has said his strategy of placing steep tariffs on Chinese imports is &ldquo;working far better than anyone ever anticipated&rdquo;, citing losses in China&rsquo;s stock market. He predicted the U.S. market could &ldquo;go up dramatically&rdquo; once trade deals were renegotiated. FX MARKETS FEARFUL Worries about trade were evident in currency markets, with the dollar edging towards a one-year high.  The dollar index, which benefits as investors rush to safety, rose 0.3 percent to 95.425 .DXY, a 2-1\/2 week high. The People's Bank of China's intervention last week to impose a reserve requirement on foreign exchange forward contracts had the desired impact of halting the slide in the yuan - in offshore markets, it fell 0.1 percent to 6.8574 CNH=EBS, well away from the 6.91 weak point plumbed last week.  The yuan has been one of the main casualties from the trade conflict, with investors speculating that the PBOC was happy for the renminbi to weaken to counter the impact of tariffs.  Traders saw Friday&rsquo;s move as an attempt by Chinese authorities to show they wanted stability, or even conciliation; others said the intervention would not prevent further yuan selling with Washington and Beijing still at loggerheads. U.S. jobs data on Friday, while weaker than expected, underlined that the world&rsquo;s largest economy is growing robustly, supporting synchronized global growth that had underpinned investor sentiment before the recent eruption of the trade dispute.  Markets are increasingly nervous about whether U.S. growth may have peaked, with concerns about rising tariffs exacerbating those fears.  The euro EUR= slipped 0.3 percent to $1.15300, a six-week low, while the stronger dollar sent the Swiss franc CNH= down half a percent.  &ldquo;The trade war concerns are supporting the dollar and there is a bit of a risk-off tone in the markets,&rdquo; said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at Credit Agricole. The British pound GBP= hit 11-month lows after the UK trade minister warned Britain was headed for a no-deal Brexit. Oil prices gained, helped by an unexpected decline in Saudi crude production. Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose more than 1 percent to $74.01, while U.S. crude oil futures CLc1 traded as much as 1.5 percent higher at $69.58 a barrel. &lt;O\/R&gt; Gold XAU= weakened on the back of a firmer dollar and was last down 0.4 percent at $1,208.77.

The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, edged down 0.16 percent after large drops in the main Chinese indexes in Asian trading. E-Minis for the S&P 500 ESc1 were little moved, slipping in and out of positive territory. Despite the better mood in European trading hours, the tariff conflict between the U.S. and China remains a live and dominant theme for markets.  &ldquo;In his latest Twitter tirades and his latest appearances in front of his supporters the U.S. president has indicated something akin to a &lsquo;strategy&rsquo; behind his trade war policy,&rdquo; Commerzbank said. &ldquo;The trade war will remain in place regardless of how much the Chinese cave in.&rdquo; China proposed tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods on Friday and a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks to resolve the row. Trump has said his strategy of placing steep tariffs on Chinese imports is &ldquo;working far better than anyone ever anticipated&rdquo;, citing losses in China&rsquo;s stock market. He predicted the U.S. market could &ldquo;go up dramatically&rdquo; once trade deals were renegotiated. FX MARKETS FEARFUL Worries about trade were evident in currency markets, with the dollar edging towards a one-year high.  The dollar index, which benefits as investors rush to safety, rose 0.3 percent to 95.425 .DXY, a 2-1\/2 week high. The People's Bank of China's intervention last week to impose a reserve requirement on foreign exchange forward contracts had the desired impact of halting the slide in the yuan - in offshore markets, it fell 0.1 percent to 6.8574 CNH=EBS, well away from the 6.91 weak point plumbed last week.  The yuan has been one of the main casualties from the trade conflict, with investors speculating that the PBOC was happy for the renminbi to weaken to counter the impact of tariffs.  Traders saw Friday&rsquo;s move as an attempt by Chinese authorities to show they wanted stability, or even conciliation; others said the intervention would not prevent further yuan selling with Washington and Beijing still at loggerheads. U.S. jobs data on Friday, while weaker than expected, underlined that the world&rsquo;s largest economy is growing robustly, supporting synchronized global growth that had underpinned investor sentiment before the recent eruption of the trade dispute.  Markets are increasingly nervous about whether U.S. growth may have peaked, with concerns about rising tariffs exacerbating those fears.  The euro EUR= slipped 0.3 percent to $1.15300, a six-week low, while the stronger dollar sent the Swiss franc CNH= down half a percent.  &ldquo;The trade war concerns are supporting the dollar and there is a bit of a risk-off tone in the markets,&rdquo; said Manuel Oliveri, currency strategist at Credit Agricole. The British pound GBP= hit 11-month lows after the UK trade minister warned Britain was headed for a no-deal Brexit. Oil prices gained, helped by an unexpected decline in Saudi crude production. Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose more than 1 percent to $74.01, while U.S. crude oil futures CLc1 traded as much as 1.5 percent higher at $69.58 a barrel. &lt;O\/R&gt; Gold XAU= weakened on the back of a firmer dollar and was last down 0.4 percent at $1,208.77.

Such services are already available in North America and Europe, but may have special appeal in Russia given the country&rsquo;s particularly harsh winters. Toplivo v Bak, which translates as &ldquo;Fuel to the Tank&rdquo;, and another company called Pump will come and fill up a car&rsquo;s fuel tank at the kerbside on receipt of an order via a smartphone app - even if the owner is not there. The services are available in four cities - Moscow, St Petersburg, Sochi and Krasnodar. The companies are riding the trend for on-demand delivery of goods pioneered by U.S. companies such as Uber and Amazon via  smartphone technology, which is taking off in Russian cities. &ldquo;You can call it &lsquo;Uberisation,&rsquo; said Alina Kovalevich, general director of Toplivo v Bak. &ldquo;We see it with taxis and food delivery, in various sectors.&rdquo; If a registered user of one of the services is running low on fuel, they tap an order into their smartphone which transmits the location of their vehicle.  The order is received electronically by a courier driving a small van with a fuel tank attached, containing petrol or diesel. When the courier arrives at the car, he pulls a fuel nozzle out of the van and inserts it into the petrol tank to fill up the car and then drives on to the next customer. If the customer leaves the petrol cap unlocked, the vehicle can be refueled without any need for them to be present. However, not all customers take up that option. &ldquo;People are afraid that if they leave the cap open, someone will pour sugar into the tank, siphon off petrol, or do something else,&rdquo; said Boris Zhidovlenkov, executive director of Toplivo v Bak. It began offering its service in 2017, a year after Pump. Most of Toplivo v Bak and Pump&rsquo;s business comes from re-fuelling vehicles operated by car-sharing companies, while the rest of their customers are private car owners. The services are not yet major players in Russia&rsquo;s fuel market. Between them, they deliver between 16,000 and 18,000 liters of fuel per day, which is about the same amount a single fuel station would sell in a day. But they have plans to grow, with the help of technology. The technology already exists for vehicles to send an automated message when they need refueling, and there are fuel caps that can be unlocked with a code the owner can share with the refueling company. &ldquo;Once they&rsquo;ve joined the service, the customer can simply forget what a fuel station is,&rdquo; said Kovalevich.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is asking for more assets to be sold than previously anticipated and also wants prospective buyers to meet certain other requirements, Linde said in a statement on Sunday. &ldquo;Linde and Praxair are analyzing these expectations to assess their scope and to evaluate how they could be implemented to achieve a timely clearance of the business combination,&rdquo; it said. Analysts said the deal was still likely to go ahead, but the risk of it falling apart had risen and, with more forced sell-offs, the benefits had diminished.     &ldquo;The probability of a no-deal scenario has increased and the synergy potential has been reduced if the deal does go through,&rdquo; said Sebastian Satz of Barclays.    The regulatory challenge is a setback for Linde Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle, who has been a driving force for the deal and had to reshuffle management following the departure of the company&rsquo;s chief executive and finance chief. The planned all-share merger, agreed in principle in December 2016, would create a global leader in gas distribution ahead of France&rsquo;s Air Liquide (AIRP.PA ), which had also bulked up with the takeover of rival Airgas. The companies agreed at the time that if regulators demanded the disposal of businesses with more than 3.7 billion euros  ($4.3 billion) in sales or 1.1 billion euros in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), either party could withdraw without penalty. Based on its discussions with the FTC and other regulators, Linde said there was a higher probability the two companies would need to sell assets exceeding the agreed threshold. The companies have so far agreed to sell assets to a consortium of German gases firm Messer and buyout group CVC, as well as to Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp (4091.T ), with combined annual sales of about 2.7 billion euros and roughly 700 million euros in EBITDA. Linde said the companies remained in constructive talks with the regulators and with each other. It declined to comment beyond its statement. Officials at Praxair were not immediately available for comment. The companies face an Oct. 24 deadline to complete the deal under German financial market rules. Linde shares were down 9.4 percent at 1306 GMT (9.06 a.m. ET), trading at a three-month low.     Jefferies analyst Laurence Alexander said the companies were likely to get relatively low prices for additional divestments, but put the probability of the deal closing at more than 85 percent. Reuters reported last month the European Commission was set to give its blessing to the tie-up after an in-depth review.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who faces an election due by the end of the year, has accused her political rivals of trying to stir up anti-government sentiment using the deaths as a pretext. The opposition has denied involvement. The crowded capital of 18 million has been paralyzed by  angry students demanding changes to transport laws following the July 29 deaths after the driver of a privately operated bus lost control and ran over a group of college students in an alleged race for passengers with another bus. &ldquo;As per the proposed law, an accused has to face five years of jail for negligent driving (leading to death),&rdquo; Law Minister Anisul Huq told reporters after a cabinet meeting chaired by Hasina.  The deliberate running over of people will draw murder charges and carry the death sentence, he added. Parliament&rsquo;s approval for the proposal to become law is seen as a formality, since Hasina&rsquo;s ruling Awami League has an overwhelming majority. Defying government warnings to end the protests, some university students on Monday threw bricks at police and others tried to take processions through the city. Police fired tear gas and used water cannon to disperse protesters, as students have stopped vehicles, demanding to check drivers&rsquo; licenses and their vehicles&rsquo; roadworthiness.

Ambassador to Bangladesh Marcia Bernicat was returning from dinner at the time of the attack.

Malaysia&rsquo;s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad thanked Indonesian President Joko Widodo, in a video posted on his Facebook page, for facilitating the yacht&rsquo;s handover. Malaysian authorities are seeking to arrest Low Taek Jho, the financier who allegedly bought the Equanimity, a 91 meter (300-foot) yacht registered in the Cayman Islands. Lawsuits have  identified him as a central figure in the 1MDB scandal, but his whereabouts are unknown. Low, through a spokesman from his legal team, has described the handing over of the yacht to Malaysia as illegal and politically motivated. &ldquo;The Mahathir regime&rsquo;s illegal act today, ignoring court rulings in legal proceedings in the U.S. and Indonesia, prove he has no interest in a fair and just process,&rdquo; he said in a statement Monday.  Low has previously denied any wrongdoing. His Malaysian passport has been revoked and an arrest warrant issued. Mahathir said any claimants to the yacht should provide proof that it belonged to them, and where they got the money to pay for it.  &ldquo;We believe the ship is owned by the Malaysian government because it was bought by Malaysian money that was stolen by certain parties,&rdquo; Mahathir said.

Malaysia is trying to recover up to $1.7 billion in assets, including the yacht, that the DoJ has alleged were bought with stolen 1MDB funds.

China proposed a set of differentiated tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports last week, retaliating to the Trump administration&rsquo;s plans of 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. Chinese state media launched a personal attack on President Donald Trump&rsquo;s trade policies on Monday, saying his trade &ldquo;extortion&rdquo; would not work. The months-long dispute has roiled financial markets across the globe, although the U.S. markets have been largely supported by a strong earnings season. Of the more than 400 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 78.6 percent have topped earnings estimates. That is well above the average of 72 percent in the past four quarters. The S&P 500 .SPX ended up 0.8 percent last week, closing a five-week run of gains, its first such winning streak this year. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re only couple of points away from an all-time high, and as we approach that, we&rsquo;re going to see a little bit of resistance,&rdquo; said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. With just 44 companies set to report this week and the calendar light on economic data, the spotlight will be on trade issues. The S&P 500 e-minis ESc1 were down 1.25 points, or 0.04 percent by 8:50 a.m. ET. The Dow e-minis 1YMc1 were down 12 points, or 0.05 percent and the Nasdaq 100 e-minis NQc1 were down 6 points, or 0.08 percent. Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKb.N ) rose 2.23 percent in premarket trading after the Warren Buffett-led conglomerate reported a 67 percent surge in quarterly operating profit. Qualcomm (QCOM.O ) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O ) rose about 1.5 percent each following positive brokerage recommendations. PepsiCo (PEP.O ) rose 0.8 percent after the company said Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi would step down in October. Intel (INTC.O ) dropped 1.2 percent after Barclays downgraded the stock to &ldquo;equal weight&rdquo;.

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is asking for more assets to be sold than previously anticipated and also wants prospective buyers to meet certain other requirements, Linde said in a statement on Sunday. &ldquo;Linde and Praxair are analyzing these expectations to assess their scope and to evaluate how they could be implemented to achieve a timely clearance of the business combination,&rdquo; it said. Analysts said the deal was still likely to go ahead, but the risk of it falling apart had risen and, with more forced sell-offs, the benefits had diminished.     &ldquo;The probability of a no-deal scenario has increased and the synergy potential has been reduced if the deal does go through,&rdquo; said Sebastian Satz of Barclays.    The regulatory challenge is a setback for Linde Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle, who has been a driving force for the deal and had to reshuffle management following the departure of the company&rsquo;s chief executive and finance chief. The planned all-share merger, agreed in principle in December 2016, would create a global leader in gas distribution ahead of France&rsquo;s Air Liquide (AIRP.PA ), which had also bulked up with the takeover of rival Airgas. The companies agreed at the time that if regulators demanded the disposal of businesses with more than 3.7 billion euros  ($4.3 billion) in sales or 1.1 billion euros in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), either party could withdraw without penalty. Based on its discussions with the FTC and other regulators, Linde said there was a higher probability the two companies would need to sell assets exceeding the agreed threshold. The companies have so far agreed to sell assets to a consortium of German gases firm Messer and buyout group CVC, as well as to Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corp (4091.T ), with combined annual sales of about 2.7 billion euros and roughly 700 million euros in EBITDA. Linde said the companies remained in constructive talks with the regulators and with each other. It declined to comment beyond its statement. Officials at Praxair were not immediately available for comment. The companies face an Oct. 24 deadline to complete the deal under German financial market rules. Linde shares were down 9.4 percent at 1306 GMT (9.06 a.m. ET), trading at a three-month low.     Jefferies analyst Laurence Alexander said the companies were likely to get relatively low prices for additional divestments, but put the probability of the deal closing at more than 85 percent. Reuters reported last month the European Commission was set to give its blessing to the tie-up after an in-depth review.

Malaysia&rsquo;s Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad thanked Indonesian President Joko Widodo, in a video posted on his Facebook page, for facilitating the yacht&rsquo;s handover. Malaysian authorities are seeking to arrest Low Taek Jho, the financier who allegedly bought the Equanimity, a 91 meter (300-foot) yacht registered in the Cayman Islands. Lawsuits have  identified him as a central figure in the 1MDB scandal, but his whereabouts are unknown. Low, through a spokesman from his legal team, has described the handing over of the yacht to Malaysia as illegal and politically motivated. &ldquo;The Mahathir regime&rsquo;s illegal act today, ignoring court rulings in legal proceedings in the U.S. and Indonesia, prove he has no interest in a fair and just process,&rdquo; he said in a statement Monday.  Low has previously denied any wrongdoing. His Malaysian passport has been revoked and an arrest warrant issued. Mahathir said any claimants to the yacht should provide proof that it belonged to them, and where they got the money to pay for it.  &ldquo;We believe the ship is owned by the Malaysian government because it was bought by Malaysian money that was stolen by certain parties,&rdquo; Mahathir said.

Such services are already available in North America and Europe, but may have special appeal in Russia given the country&rsquo;s particularly harsh winters. Toplivo v Bak, which translates as &ldquo;Fuel to the Tank&rdquo;, and another company called Pump will come and fill up a car&rsquo;s fuel tank at the kerbside on receipt of an order via a smartphone app - even if the owner is not there. The services are available in four cities - Moscow, St Petersburg, Sochi and Krasnodar. The companies are riding the trend for on-demand delivery of goods pioneered by U.S. companies such as Uber and Amazon via  smartphone technology, which is taking off in Russian cities. &ldquo;You can call it &lsquo;Uberisation,&rsquo; said Alina Kovalevich, general director of Toplivo v Bak. &ldquo;We see it with taxis and food delivery, in various sectors.&rdquo; If a registered user of one of the services is running low on fuel, they tap an order into their smartphone which transmits the location of their vehicle.  The order is received electronically by a courier driving a small van with a fuel tank attached, containing petrol or diesel. When the courier arrives at the car, he pulls a fuel nozzle out of the van and inserts it into the petrol tank to fill up the car and then drives on to the next customer. If the customer leaves the petrol cap unlocked, the vehicle can be refueled without any need for them to be present. However, not all customers take up that option. &ldquo;People are afraid that if they leave the cap open, someone will pour sugar into the tank, siphon off petrol, or do something else,&rdquo; said Boris Zhidovlenkov, executive director of Toplivo v Bak. It began offering its service in 2017, a year after Pump. Most of Toplivo v Bak and Pump&rsquo;s business comes from re-fuelling vehicles operated by car-sharing companies, while the rest of their customers are private car owners. The services are not yet major players in Russia&rsquo;s fuel market. Between them, they deliver between 16,000 and 18,000 liters of fuel per day, which is about the same amount a single fuel station would sell in a day. But they have plans to grow, with the help of technology. The technology already exists for vehicles to send an automated message when they need refueling, and there are fuel caps that can be unlocked with a code the owner can share with the refueling company. &ldquo;Once they&rsquo;ve joined the service, the customer can simply forget what a fuel station is,&rdquo; said Kovalevich.

Casado, who took over the former ruling party last month, denied any wrongdoing and said he was unaware of any irregularities in the awarding of his master&rsquo;s degree nine years ago, adding that he had no plans to step down over the case. The court said it could not hear the case due to immunity laws for members of parliament. However, it passed the case to the Supreme Court which must decide whether to proceed. Spain&rsquo;s top court holds final authority in interpreting the immunity laws. In its findings, the lower court said there were signs of   bribery in the awarding of degrees to a number of people including Casado. &ldquo;The director of the course ... acted so that a particular, chosen group of students were given a master&rsquo;s degree (...) without any academic merit, giving it to them as a gift,&rdquo; the ruling said.

REUTERS\/Javier Barbancho\/File Photo Casado, who replaced former prime minister Mariano Rajoy as PP chief, rejected this finding. &ldquo;Under no circumstances have I accepted a gift or requested something that was not given to any other students,&rdquo; he told a news conference. The masters degree was awarded to Casado in 2009 by Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid. The case is the latest to rock the PP, which led Spain from 2011 until June 1 this year when Rajoy&rsquo;s government lost a parliamentary no-confidence vote. This followed the prosecution of dozens of people linked to the PP in a corruption case. Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez now heads a minority government.  Casado, has taken the PP to the right since becoming leader on July 21, faces an uphill struggle to regain voters. According to a poll published last week, the Socialists now lead with 29.9 percent.  The PP has fallen into joint second place with the market-friendly Ciudadanos party with 20.4 percent, according to the poll by the Sociological Research Centre. In April, the head of the Madrid region Cristina Cifuentes, also a PP member, resigned after claims she had falsified her masters degree.

The transaction is still subject to approval by regulators, the filing said. Several salmon producing companies in Chile have moved to consolidate in recent months as demand and prices for salmon have increased and Chilean operations recover from several years of devastating outbreaks of red tide and salmon-specific viruses.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who faces an election due by the end of the year, has accused her political rivals of trying to stir up anti-government sentiment using the deaths as a pretext. The opposition has denied involvement. The crowded capital of 18 million has been paralyzed by  angry students demanding changes to transport laws following the July 29 deaths after the driver of a privately operated bus lost control and ran over a group of college students in an alleged race for passengers with another bus. &ldquo;As per the proposed law, an accused has to face five years of jail for negligent driving (leading to death),&rdquo; Law Minister Anisul Huq told reporters after a cabinet meeting chaired by Hasina.  The deliberate running over of people will draw murder charges and carry the death sentence, he added. Parliament&rsquo;s approval for the proposal to become law is seen as a formality, since Hasina&rsquo;s ruling Awami League has an overwhelming majority. Defying government warnings to end the protests, some university students on Monday threw bricks at police and others tried to take processions through the city. Police fired tear gas and used water cannon to disperse protesters, as students have stopped vehicles, demanding to check drivers&rsquo; licenses and their vehicles&rsquo; roadworthiness.  Students run after clashes with the police during a protest over recent traffic accidents that killed a boy and a girl, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, August 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Mohammad Ponir Hossain Police said they were still investigating Sunday&rsquo;s attack on a car carrying the U.S. ambassador by a group of armed men, some riding motorcycles. There were no injuries but two vehicles were damaged. The U.S. embassy said it was not in a position to comment until the investigation was complete. Ambassador to Bangladesh Marcia Bernicat was returning from dinner at the time of the attack.  Earlier the embassy had criticized the police crackdown on the protesters, whom it described as having &ldquo;united and captured the imagination of the whole country&rdquo;. Last week police beat some students in their efforts to disperse them. ARREST Police have arrested social activist and photographer Shahidul Alam who had posted comments that a student wing of Hasina&rsquo;s ruling party was trying to attack the protesters.   Alam&rsquo;s organization, Drik Picture Library, said 30 to 35 men in plainclothes swept into his Dhaka apartment building, saying they were police detectives, and took him into custody. Alam was screaming as he was forced into a car, it quoted security guards at the building as saying. Students block a road as they join in a protest over recent traffic accidents that killed a boy and a girl, in Dhaka, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, August 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Mohammad Ponir Hossain Dhaka&rsquo;s additional deputy commissioner of police, Obaidur Rahman, said Alam was arrested on charges of spreading rumors on social media, aiming to incite violence. Rights group Amnesty International called for Alam&rsquo;s immediate and unconditional release, saying he was held after an interview to Al-Jazeera English on the Dhaka protests. &ldquo;There is no justification whatsoever for detaining anyone for solely peacefully expressing their views,&rdquo; Omar Waraich, Amnesty&rsquo;s deputy South Asia director, said in a statement. &ldquo;The Bangladeshi government must end the crackdown on the student protesters and people speaking out against it.&rdquo; Traffic laws are poorly enforced and the students blame the private bus network for mishaps in a city choked by massive traffic jams. Road accidents kill 12,000 people and cause 35,000 injuries in Bangladesh each year, says the Accident Research Institute of state-run Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.  Sheikh Shafi, a polytechnic student injured in a protest on Saturday, said one problem was that bus drivers must work long hours as they do not receive monthly salaries but are paid commissions based on passenger numbers instead. &ldquo;Our demand is that the owners must appoint them and they will work a maximum of 10 hours. The commission-based system must be eliminated,&rdquo; said Shafi, whose brother died in a road accident in 2015.

The tariff on imported roughage like hay and silo maize will be brought down to zero from three Swiss francs per 100 kg, a spokesman for the federal agriculture agency said.  He said it was unclear at this stage what the measures would ultimately cost. Although domestic hay harvesting has been good in most locations, persistent drought in some regions has led to supply shortages that can be offset only in part from domestic sources, it said. &ldquo;Tariff reductions partly compensate for the rise in import prices and are therefore intended to benefit farmers,&rdquo; it added. &ldquo;The greatest difficulty for farmers concerned is the maintenance of liquidity and the general improvement of the operating situation.

They had court-appointed lawyers present on Monday but had neither met with nor spoken to them, they said. The sentences can be appealed.    Embassy staff and translators from both countries attended Monday&rsquo;s hearing. Hermann was sentenced in January to a year in jail for entering Iraq illegally.  Asked by the judge whether she believed in Islamic State&rsquo;s ideology, she said no. However, she earlier admitted to the judge that she had received a salary of 50,000 Iraqi dinars ($42) per month, which confirmed her membership to the group.  &ldquo;This whole process is confusing,&rdquo; Hermann, who wore a blue prison uniform over a black abaya and a grey headscarf, told Reuters before the verdict, speaking in German from the holding cell, in the presence of Iraqi prison guards. Hermann was the only woman being tried on charges relating to Islamic State on Monday. Iraq has been prosecuting women of various nationalities for months, and was sentencing roughly 10 women a day at the peak of trials in the spring.  Around 20 foreign women, including nationals of Turkey, Germany and Azerbaijan, have been sentenced to death for membership of Islamic State.

China proposed retaliatory tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods ranging from liquefied natural gas (LNG) to some aircraft on Friday, as a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks with Washington to solve their bitter trade conflict. Some analysts see trade tensions as beneficial for the U.S. dollar as the economy is better placed to handle protectionism than emerging markets, and as tariffs may narrow the U.S. trade deficit. &ldquo;Trade tensions are very much dollar positive so I suspect that&rsquo;s contributing to the dollar gains today,&rdquo; said Erik Nelson, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. Against a broad basket of currencies .DXY, the dollar was last up 0.24 percent to 95.369 and is within striking distance of more-than-one-year peak of 95.652 reached on July 19. The dollar&rsquo;s gains have been more pronounced against emerging-market currencies as investors bet that an escalation in trade war concerns would hit these export-oriented economies harder. Chinese stocks .SSEC slumped nearly 2 percent on Monday. Since mid-April, the dollar index .DXY has gained 6 percent while an emerging-market local currency bond exchange traded fund (LEMB.K ) has fallen more than 10 percent over the same period. The greenback was also boosted on Monday by disappointing German data and concerns about the U.K.&rsquo;s plan to leave the eurozone. The euro EUR=EBS fell to a five-week low of $1.1527 as German industrial orders fell more than expected in June, posting their steepest monthly drop in nearly a year and a half. The single currency was last down 0.1 percent at $1.1555. Britain&rsquo;s pound sank to an 11-month low as comments by officials about a no-deal Brexit stoked fears Britain would crash out of the European Union without securing a trade agreement. The main U.S. economic focus this week will be Friday&rsquo;s consumer price inflation report for July, which is expected to show a 0.2 percent increase in core inflation in the month, according to a Reuters poll. ======================================================== Currency bid prices at 10:17AM (1417 GMT)            Description      RIC         Last           U.S. Close  Pct Change     YTD Pct     High Bid    Low Bid                                                                  Previous                   Change                                                                                    Session                                                                  Euro\/Dollar      EUR=        $1.1553        $1.1567     -0.12%         +0.00%      +1.1573     +1.1530                      Dollar\/Yen       JPY=        111.4100       111.2500    +0.14%         +0.00%      +111.5200   +111.1600                      Euro\/Yen         EURJPY=     128.75         128.70      +0.04%         +0.00%      +128.7800   +128.5100                      Dollar\/Swiss     CHF=        0.9972         0.9941      +0.31%         +0.00%      +0.9984     +0.9940                      Sterling\/Dollar  GBP=        1.2939         1.3005      -0.51%         +0.00%      +1.3017     +1.2920                      Dollar\/Canadian  CAD=        1.3011         1.2988      +0.18%         +0.00%      +1.3039     +1.2988                      Australian\/Doll  AUD=        0.7381         0.7399      -0.24%         +0.00%      +0.7405     +0.7375                      ar                                                                                                                   Euro\/Swiss       EURCHF=     1.1522         1.1500      +0.19%         +0.00%      +1.1525     +1.1499                      Euro\/Sterling    EURGBP=     0.8927         0.8895      +0.36%         +0.00%      +0.8932     +0.8891                      NZ Dollar\/Dolar  NZD=        0.6730         0.6741      -0.16%         +0.00%      +0.6755     +0.6725                      Dollar\/Norway    NOK=        8.2431         8.2536      -0.13%         +0.00%      +8.2670     +8.2436                      Euro\/Norway      EURNOK=     9.5248         9.5490      -0.25%         +0.00%      +9.5536     +9.5269                      Dollar\/Sweden    SEK=        8.9255         8.9133      +0.05%         +0.00%      +8.9397     +8.9095                      Euro\/Sweden      EURSEK=     10.3135        10.3086     +0.05%         +0.00%      +10.3209    +10.2980           "},"c573da63a1de082b29a412b6a24732a5":{"title":"U.S. sees sanctions having significant impact on Iran economy: U.S. officials","text":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration will aggressively enforce economic sanctions that is it re-imposing on Iran this week and expects the measures to have a significant impact on the Iranian economy, senior U.S. administration officials said on Monday. The so-called snapback sanctions would target Iran&rsquo;s purchases of U.S. dollars, metals trading and other dealings, coal, industrial-related software and its auto sector.      The officials added that Trump was ready to meet with Iran&rsquo;s leaders at any time in an effort to forge a new agreement with Tehran after President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear deal in May. &ldquo;There is no question that these financial sanctions are going to continue to bring significant financial pressure,&rdquo; one official told reporters on a conference call.  Washington is due to bring back some of the measures against Iran that it suspended under the 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran under which international sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program. Some of the sanctions will come back on Tuesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT). The United States also plans to re-introduce potentially more damaging sanctions on Iranian oil in November. The renewed sanctions are part of the broader strategy under Trump aimed at cutting off the Iranian leadership&rsquo;s access to resources. They are aimed at modifying Iran&rsquo;s behavior not bring about a &ldquo;regime change&rdquo; targeting President Hassan Rouhani, the officials added. The officials said the Iranian government&rsquo;s handling of current social and labor protests in were concerning. &ldquo;We are deeply concerned about reports of Iranian regime&rsquo;s violence against unarmed citizens,&rdquo; one official said. &ldquo;The United States supports the Iranian people&rsquo;s right to peacefully protest against corruption and oppression without fear of reprisal,&rdquo; the official added. Trump &ldquo;will meet with the Iranian leadership at any time to discuss a real comprehensive deal that will contain their regional ambitions, will end their malign behavior and deny them any path  to a nuclear weapon,&rdquo; one official said.  Asked about any possible exemptions to the renewed sanctions, officials said they would examine any requests on a case-by-case basis.

A London court in June froze the gas giant&rsquo;s assets in Britain at the request of Naftogaz. The Ukrainian company was seeking to enforce an earlier arbitration ruling from Sweden that ordered Gazprom to pay it $2.6 billion.  The British verdict is likely to have spooked Western banks that traditionally work with Gazprom because it raises the possibility that any new funds the company might raise via London could also be frozen, one of the sources said.     Gazprom is still able to raise funds on the Russian market, recently testing investors&rsquo; appetite with a 40 billion rouble bond ($630 million), but the situation means it faces higher borrowing costs and prolonged regulatory uncertainty, the bankers say.        Gazprom, which is on the hook to repay $15.2 billion in external debt this year, had planned to start meeting investors to test their appetite for a potential sterling Eurobond in the middle of June, a Russian banker involved in that deal said.  However, the deal was canceled days before the British court&rsquo;s June 18 announcement, the banker said.  He said that the decision was made as the relationship between Moscow and the West grew increasingly tense because of U.S. sanctions against Russian businessmen and a row over former spy Sergei Skripal&rsquo;s assassination attempt on British soil. Russia has denied any involvement.  Two other London-based bankers said the decision to call off the Eurobond issue was also taken as Gazprom adopted a cautious stance ahead of the London ruling.  One of the sources, who all declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the matter, said that Gazprom had also planned to sell Eurobonds in euros and Japanese yen in the autumn, but that those plans had stalled too.     Meanwhile, one of the banks that works with Gazprom put a loan for the Russian firm on hold until the situation around its finances in the West became clearer, the same source said.    Gazprom declined to comment.     &ldquo;As I understand it, settlements with foreign banks done via London are affected,&rdquo; another banker said.     A third source, citing a banker who works with Gazprom, said Gazprom had stopped making any payments through banks in Britain.  However, the London court&rsquo;s ruling does not prevent the company from servicing outstanding debt, a lawyer familiar with the process said.

It is currently building two new pipelines to southern Europe and China, and preparing to start construction of the Nord Stream 2 to Western Europe under a projected investment program of 1.3 trillion roubles this year.  Gazprom has a sufficient cash cushion to deal with its costs but western financing is a cheaper alternative for the company, the bankers said. In March, prior to the London court ruling, Gazprom raised 750 million Swiss francs via a 5-year Eurobond where UBS (UBSG.S ) was the only Western bank involved, and another 750 million euros in an 8-year Eurobond arranged by Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE ) and JPMorgan (JPM.N ) along with three Russian banks.

The so-called snapback sanctions, due to come into force early on Tuesday, would target Iran&rsquo;s purchases of U.S. dollars, metals trading and other dealings, coal, industrial-related software and its auto sector.    Iran&rsquo;s rial currency has lost half its value since April under the threat of revived U.S. sanctions. The plunge in the currency and soaring inflation have sparked sporadic demonstrations in Iran against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans. The sanctions aim to modify Iran&rsquo;s behavior and not bring about a &ldquo;regime change&rdquo; targeting President Hassan Rouhani, the U.S. officials said. They said the Iranian government&rsquo;s handling of social and labor protests was a concern. Trump is aiming to cut off the Iranian leadership&rsquo;s access to resources, the officials say. The United States also plans to re-introduce potentially more damaging sanctions on Iranian oil in November. The sanctions being brought back on Tuesday were among those lifted under the 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran on curbing Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program. Foes for decades, the United States and Iran have been increasingly at odds over Iran&rsquo;s growing political and military influence in the Middle East since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017. Trump announced in May this year he would withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal.

The so-called snapback sanctions, due to come into force early on Tuesday, would target Iran&rsquo;s purchases of U.S. dollars, metals trading and other dealings, coal, industrial-related software and its auto sector.    Iran&rsquo;s rial currency has lost half its value since April under the threat of revived U.S. sanctions. The plunge in the currency and soaring inflation have sparked sporadic demonstrations in Iran against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans. The sanctions aim to modify Iran&rsquo;s behavior and not bring about a &ldquo;regime change&rdquo; targeting President Hassan Rouhani, the U.S. officials said. They said the Iranian government&rsquo;s handling of social and labor protests was a concern. Trump is aiming to cut off the Iranian leadership&rsquo;s access to resources, the officials say. The United States also plans to re-introduce potentially more damaging sanctions on Iranian oil in November. The sanctions being brought back on Tuesday were among those lifted under the 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran on curbing Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program. Foes for decades, the United States and Iran have been increasingly at odds over Iran&rsquo;s growing political and military influence in the Middle East since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017. Trump announced in May this year he would withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal.

The tariff on imports of hay and silo maize would be brought down to zero from three Swiss francs per 100 kg, a spokesman for the federal agriculture agency said.  &ldquo;The persistent drought puts agriculture in a difficult situation in various areas,&rdquo; the government said in a statement, outlining measures that will complement steps taken by individual cantons. The measures to help Swiss farmers came as the heat wave pushed the water temperature in parts of the Rhine river above 27 degrees Celsius (80.6\u00b0F), killing thousands of fish and forcing trout and grayling to try to find cooler waters. Fishery authorities in three Swiss cantons along the river said that despite measures to add cool water about one tonne of dead fish had been collected so far, representing a quarter to a third of the annual catch volume. &ldquo;Given the weather situation, a further increase in dead fish is expected over the next few days. A mass extinction as in the hot summer of 2003, when 90 percent of the entire grayling population died, hopefully will not occur,&rdquo; a statement said.  Although domestic hay harvesting has been good in most locations, persistent drought in some regions has led to supply shortages that can be offset only in part from domestic sources, it said. &ldquo;Tariff reductions partly compensate for the rise in import prices and are therefore intended to benefit farmers,&rdquo; it added. &ldquo;The greatest difficulty for farmers concerned is the maintenance of liquidity and the general improvement of the operating situation. A repayable, interest-free operating loan can help here,&rdquo; it said.

Six people were killed in an army clampdown last week after violent protests and amid opposition claims of vote-rigging, in  scenes reminiscent of the long rule of Robert Mugabe, when the security forces became a byword for heavy-handedness. Opposition leader Nelson Chamisa has rejected Mnangagwa&rsquo;s victory, which made him the first elected head of state since Mugabe&rsquo;s removal from power in November, and has promised to use legal and constitutional means to challenge the poll outcome.  His spokesman Nkululeko Sibanda said lawyers would announce on Tuesday when Chamisa will launch a formal challenge to the election result in court. Sibanda told Reuters that masked soldiers had abducted several MDC members in raids late at night and at dawn over the weekend in the capital Harare and assaulted people in townships, echoing Mugabe-era tactics against opponents.  He said soldiers had also visited the homes of opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) chairman Morgen Komichi and party youth leader Happymore Chidziva, but the two were in hiding. &ldquo;The military is trying to discourage and to prevent anything and people from resisting the electoral theft by abducting and torturing people, but this will all come to nothing,&rdquo; Sibanda said. &ldquo;We have these things, but people are not swayed.&rdquo; Amnesty International says more than 60 people were arbitrarily arrested in a &ldquo;vicious campaign of torture, intimidation and suppression of dissenting voices.&rdquo; Chamisa is under pressure from angry supporters to indicate his next move after disputing the vote. The 40-year-old leader is faced with three choices, to accept defeat and move on, challenge the results in court or mobilize supporters for mass protests, which could lead to more bloodshed. Army spokesman Overson Mugwisi did not respond to calls and questions send by Reuters. Police spokeswoman Charity Charamba said she was not aware of the abductions, adding &ldquo;everyone has a right to report such incidences to the police.&rdquo; Anti-riot police and their water cannon left the MDC offices from where they were camped from last Wednesday. Mnangagwa has said the army&rsquo;s use of violence in Harare after the vote would be investigated independently, although he also suggested he understood the resort to military force, remarking that police were overwhelmed by opposition protesters. On Monday, 27 MDC members were appearing in court to seek bail after they were arrested during last week&rsquo;s violence. &ldquo;They simply want to instill fear into our people,&rdquo; MDC secretary general Douglas Mwonzora said.   Zimbabweans had hoped the first post-Mugabe polls would move the country away from a history of disputed elections. Mnangagwa faces the challenge of persuading the international community that the army crackdown and lapses in the election process will not derail his promise of political and economic reforms needed to fix a failing economy.

U.S. District Judge John Bates in Washington, D.C., said he would stay Friday&rsquo;s order, however, until August 23 to give the administration time to decide whether to appeal.  Bates first issued a ruling in April ordering the federal government to continue the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, including taking applications. He stayed that ruling for 90 days to give the government time to better explain why the program should be ended.  On Friday Bates, who was appointed by former President George W. Bush, a Republican, said he would not revise his previous ruling because the arguments of President Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration did not override his concerns. Under DACA, roughly 700,000 young adults, often referred to as &ldquo;Dreamers&rdquo;, were protected from deportation and given work permits for two-year periods, after which they must re-apply to the program.  The program was created in 2012 under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.  Two other federal courts in California and New York had previously ordered that DACA remain in place while litigation challenging Trump&rsquo;s decision to end it continued. Those rulings only required the government to process DACA renewals, not new applications.  Another lawsuit in a Texas federal court is seeking to end DACA. A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday that the government would continue to defend its position that it &ldquo;acted within its lawful authority in deciding to wind down DACA in an orderly manner.&rdquo; Congress so far has failed to pass legislation to address the fate of the Dreamers, including a potential path to citizenship. Friday&rsquo;s ruling came in lawsuits filed by several groups and institutions, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Princeton University.

Fire officials expect it to take another nine days to fully contain the so-called Mendocino Complex Fire, which had scorched 273,664 acres (110,748 hectares) by Monday morning, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, an area nearly the size of Los Angeles.  &ldquo;Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re not going to get a break anytime soon,&rdquo; Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service&rsquo;s Weather Prediction Center, said in an interview on Monday. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty doggone hot and dry, and it&rsquo;s going to stay that way.&rdquo; Some areas in Central and Northern California could see temperatures reach 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 Celsius) and winds of 15 miles (24 km) per hour, with higher gusts that could fan the flames and spread embers, he said. Environmentalists and some politicians say the uptick in the intensity of the state&rsquo;s wildfire season may be linked in part to climate change. The Mendocino Complex Fire has destroyed 75 homes and forced thousands to flee.  Still only 30 percent contained, it is one of 17 major wildfires burning across California that prompted Trump to declare a &ldquo;major disaster&rdquo; in the state on Sunday, ordering federal funding to be made available to help recovery efforts. &ldquo;California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren&rsquo;t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized,&rdquo; Trump wrote on Twitter. Another fire, the nearly two-week-old Carr Fire, claimed another life on Saturday, a 21-year-old apprentice lineman, Jay Ayeta, officials with PG&E Corp said on Sunday.  Ayeta died when his vehicle crashed as he worked with crews in dangerous terrain in Shasta County.  He was the seventh person to die in that blaze, which has scorched more than 160,000 acres (64,750 hectares) in the scenic Shasta-Trinity region north of Sacramento, including two young children and their great-grandmother whose home was overrun by flames, and two firefighters. The Carr Fire is now the 12th largest fire recorded in the state. Firefighters had managed to contain 45 percent of the Carr blaze by Monday morning, and authorities were letting some evacuees return.

The settlement resolved U.S. lawsuits filed by Cisco alleging Arista copied its intellectual property. The deal also called for Arista to drop a lawsuit alleging Cisco engaged in anticompetitive conduct to preserve its dominant share of the ethernet switch market. The jury trial in that case was set to begin on Monday in San Jose, California. A spokesman for Arista and spokeswoman for Cisco did not immediately respond to request for comment.  Founded in 2004 by former Cisco engineers, Arista has emerged as a rival to Cisco in the multibillion-dollar market for ethernet switches used in data centers. Cisco sued Arista in 2014, alleging it brazenly copied software that runs switching products and other technology protected by patents and copyrights. Arista has denied the allegations and accused Cisco of a smear campaign intended to stifle competition. The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in 2016 that Arista infringed three patents and recommended a limited ban on Arista&rsquo;s products that infringe the patents. Arista said that in an effort to comply with the ITC&rsquo;s ruling it redesigned its technology to remove elements found to infringe Cisco&rsquo;s patents. Arista scored a major victory of its own in 2016, when a U.S. jury said it owed no damages over Cisco&rsquo;s claims of copyright infringement. The settlement came shortly before a trial in a 2016 antitrust lawsuit filed by Arista. It alleged Cisco permitted rivals to use its interface technology and then later, after they were locked into using it, claimed copyright protection on it. Cisco denied the allegations in court filings, saying it never encouraged Arista to adopt its technology and that it acted reasonably in suing for copyright infringement.

The EU and other parties to the 2015 deal, China and Russia, are working to maintain trade with Iran, which has threatened to stop complying with curbs on its nuclear work if it fails to see the economic benefits of relief from sanctions under the deal. &ldquo;We deeply regret the re-imposition of sanctions by the U.S.,&rdquo; the bloc said in a joint statement with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Britain. They pledged to work on preserving financial flows and Iran&rsquo;s oil and gas exports - a lifeline of its economy. EU officials hope the EU&rsquo;s so-called blocking statute will mitigate the impact of U.S. sanctions for business, including by deterring U.S. authorities from enforcing some penalties. But they admit it may not be enough to convince European firms to brave U.S. penalties in order to do business with Iran. Senior U.S. administration officials brushed off questions about the EU measure on Monday, warning the risks were real for companies working in Iran. The new measure forbids EU persons from complying with U.S. sanctions or related court rulings and allows for firms to sue in court to recover potential damages from parties who withdraw from contracts due to U.S. sanctions. &ldquo;For those who have exposure, there is no panacea. What this does is it provides a deterrence. It means that sanctions that are discretionary may never be applied,&rdquo; one senior EU official said, adding that firms have rarely been fined under U.S. secondary sanctions in the past. &ldquo;If they (sanctions) are applied, then that person can go to the court to recover that damage.&rdquo;  &lsquo;PROTECT NOT OBLIGE&rsquo; Under the new rules, firms should apply for EU authorization to wind down operations in Iran if it is doing so to comply with U.S. sanctions but not if it is a business decision - a distinction that may be difficult to make. The threat of EU penalties for European firms who fail to seek such a legal exemption for withdrawing from Iran due to U.S. sanctions has raised alarm among EU businesses that they could be penalized either way. Seeking to ease concerns, EU officials have stressed the measure seeks to &ldquo;free not force&rdquo; firms to remain invested in Iran. EU officials say they will be strict in reviewing requests for exemptions - wary to undermine its effect by granting too many authorizations. A number of other countries have asked EU officials for details on the blocking regulations as they also explore ways to bypass sanctions and their effect on oil markets: &ldquo;There is a clear interest around the world,&rdquo; one EU official said. With the U.S. administration taking a hard line on granting waivers from sanctions, many major companies from the oil and gas industry to car manufacturers and consumer goods firms have already announced that they are quitting the country. German exports to Iran alone fell by four percent in the first five months of 2018 after rising by 16 percent last year, the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHK) said.

The settlement resolved U.S. lawsuits filed by Cisco alleging Arista copied its intellectual property. The deal also called for Arista to drop a lawsuit alleging Cisco engaged in anticompetitive conduct to preserve its dominant share of the ethernet switch market. The jury trial in that case was set to begin on Monday in San Jose, California. A spokesman for Arista and spokeswoman for Cisco did not immediately respond to request for comment.  Founded in 2004 by former Cisco engineers, Arista has emerged as a rival to Cisco in the multibillion-dollar market for ethernet switches used in data centers. Cisco sued Arista in 2014, alleging it brazenly copied software that runs switching products and other technology protected by patents and copyrights. Arista has denied the allegations and accused Cisco of a smear campaign intended to stifle competition. The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled in 2016 that Arista infringed three patents and recommended a limited ban on Arista&rsquo;s products that infringe the patents. Arista said that in an effort to comply with the ITC&rsquo;s ruling it redesigned its technology to remove elements found to infringe Cisco&rsquo;s patents. Arista scored a major victory of its own in 2016, when a U.S. jury said it owed no damages over Cisco&rsquo;s claims of copyright infringement. The settlement came shortly before a trial in a 2016 antitrust lawsuit filed by Arista. It alleged Cisco permitted rivals to use its interface technology and then later, after they were locked into using it, claimed copyright protection on it. Cisco denied the allegations in court filings, saying it never encouraged Arista to adopt its technology and that it acted reasonably in suing for copyright infringement.

The newspaper said prosecutors had completed the extradition request and it was ready for submission. Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain&rsquo;s MI6 foreign spy service, and his daughter Yulia, were found unconscious on a public bench in Salisbury in early March. Britain blamed Russia for the poisonings and identified the poison as Novichok, a deadly group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s. Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack. The extradition request is likely to be rejected by Russia - and risks inflaming diplomatic tensions between London and Moscow, which are the worst since the Cold War. The Russian constitution forbids the extradition of Russian citizens to another state. Russian officials refused to hand over the men wanted for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko with a rare radioactive isotope in 2006. An investigation by hundreds of British police and intelligence officers have pieced together the movements of the two Russians, from their entry into Britain through to their departure, the Guardian reported. Britain&rsquo;s interior ministry and the Crown Prosecution Service declined to comment. After the attack on the Skripals, allies in Europe and the United States sided with Britain&rsquo;s view of the attack and ordered the biggest expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War. Russia retaliated by expelling Western diplomats. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement and accused the British intelligence agencies of staging the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria. Since then, a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, died last month after coming across a small bottle containing Novichok near Salisbury where the Skripals were struck down. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, was also stricken.

"},"40b24aa52400819f9b47398f42d2262a":{"title":"UK to ask Russia to extradite suspects in nerve agent attack: Guardian newspaper","text":"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is ready to ask Russia to extradite two men it suspects of carrying out a nerve agent attack on a Russian former spy in the English city of Salisbury, the Guardian newspaper reported on Monday, citing government and security sources. The newspaper said prosecutors had completed the extradition request and it was ready for submission. Sergei Skripal, a former colonel in Russian military intelligence who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain&rsquo;s MI6 foreign spy service, and his daughter Yulia, were found unconscious on a public bench in Salisbury in early March. Britain blamed Russia for the poisonings and identified the poison as Novichok, a deadly group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet military in the 1970s and 1980s. Russia has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack. The extradition request is likely to be rejected by Russia - and risks inflaming diplomatic tensions between London and Moscow, which are the worst since the Cold War. The Russian constitution forbids the extradition of Russian citizens to another state. Russian officials refused to hand over the men wanted for the murder of Alexander Litvinenko with a rare radioactive isotope in 2006. An investigation by hundreds of British police and intelligence officers have pieced together the movements of the two Russians, from their entry into Britain through to their departure, the Guardian reported. Britain&rsquo;s interior ministry and the Crown Prosecution Service declined to comment. After the attack on the Skripals, allies in Europe and the United States sided with Britain&rsquo;s view of the attack and ordered the biggest expulsion of Russian diplomats since the height of the Cold War. Russia retaliated by expelling Western diplomats. Moscow has repeatedly denied any involvement and accused the British intelligence agencies of staging the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria. Since then, a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, died last month after coming across a small bottle containing Novichok near Salisbury where the Skripals were struck down. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, was also stricken. The motive for attacking Skripal, then aged 66 who was exchanged in a Kremlin-approved spy swap in 2010, is still unclear, as is the motive for using an exotic nerve agent which has such clear links to Russia&rsquo;s Soviet past.

The alleged incident took place during a visit to Slovakia by Vietnamese public security minister To Lam in July 2017.  German prosecutors have said businessman Trinh Xuan Thanh, who had sought asylum in Germany, was abducted in a Berlin street by Vietnamese secret service agent and taken back to Vietnam, where he was tried and jailed for life. On Thursday, the daily Dennik N cited several Slovak police officers as confirming Thanh was smuggled to Vietnam on a Slovak government plane. Thanh was taken in a van from Berlin via Prague to Bratislava, where was added to the Vietnamese minister&rsquo;s delegation and left on a Slovak government plane, according to the Dennik N report.  The case soured relations between Germany and Vietnam and prompted Germany to accuse Vietnam of breaching international law. A German court in July sentenced a Vietnamese man to three years and 10 months in jail after he confessed to helping his country&rsquo;s secret services kidnap Thanh. Slovakia has sought to distance itself from the incident and former interior minister Robert Kalinak on Friday denied any involvement in the kidnapping, calling the story &ldquo;science-fiction&rdquo;. On Monday, the Interior Ministry said in a statement: &ldquo;Interior Minister Denisa Sakova decided on August 6 that (the policemen) will have their discretion lifted in the case of information on the kidnapping of a Vietnamese citizen from Germany to Vietnam&rdquo;. The allegations have strained Slovakia&rsquo;s three-party ruling coalition. Junior partner Most-Hid party said on Monday it could not stay in the coalition if the media reports about the case were confirmed. Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini said on Friday he would send Sakova and police chief Milan Lucansky to Germany to cooperate with Berlin police.

The U.S. Trade Representative&rsquo;s (USTR) review, announced on Friday, came after Ankara imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to American tariffs on steel and aluminum. The currency TRYTOM=D3 has lost 27 percent of its value this year, battered primarily by concerns about President Tayyip Erdogan's drive for greater control over monetary policy. On Monday, it fell more than 3 percent to a record low of 5.27 against the dollar.  The sell-off prompted the central bank to step in and loosen the upper limit of banks&rsquo; reserve requirements. However, that did little to prop up the lira, which also hit a record low versus the euro. &ldquo;The best bet now is to expect further weakness in the lira - Turkey really doesn&rsquo;t need this,&rdquo; said Per Hammarlund, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB. &ldquo;They should be doing more to support the lira, but in my view this will continue for a while longer and the lira will take another beating here.&rdquo; VEHICLE PARTS, JEWELRY The U.S. Trade Representative&rsquo;s office said the review could affect $1.66 billion worth of Turkish imports into the United States that benefited from the Generalised System of Preferences  program last year. They included motor vehicles and parts, jewelry, precious metals and stone products. It was unclear whether any large, listed Turkish firms would be hit. Auto parts suppliers tend to be smaller, unlisted companies. Istanbul's main index .XU100 fell 1.5 percent. Data from the U.S. International Trade Commission showed that the biggest beneficiary of the duty-free program were auto and auto parts makers, with exports of nearly $250 million last year. That was followed by precious stones and metals, at nearly $210 million.  A USTR spokeswoman said the review was unrelated to the case of Andrew Brunson, an American evangelical pastor who has lived in Turkey for more than two decades and is charged with supporting the group Ankara blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Relations between the NATO allies have steadily worsened, strained by differences on Syria policy and over Brunson&rsquo;s trial, exacerbating the sell-off in the lira. The central bank said its move on the reserve requirements would free up $2.2 billion in liquidity for banks. The central bank could be expected to take similar moves ahead of its next policy meeting on Sept. 13, one forex banker said. Washington last week imposed sanctions on Erdogan&rsquo;s justice minister and interior ministers, saying they played leading roles in organizations responsible for Brunson&rsquo;s arrest. Erdogan said Turkey would retaliate by freezing assets of the U.S. interior and justice ministers in Turkey &ldquo;if they have any&rdquo;. &ldquo;For a meaningful recovery in the lira, we&rsquo;re going to have to watch the news flow,&rdquo; said another Istanbul-based banker, who declined to be identified.

Forty allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse were made during the last three months of 2017 alone against U.N. peacekeeping missions, agencies, funds and programs and implementing partners, the world body said in February.  In a report issued on Monday, inspectors said several high-profile cases in U.N. organizations pointed to policies and practices that &ldquo;appear to have failed to meet the high standards of accountability that these entities espouse.&rdquo; &ldquo;Over the past few years, there have been high-profile cases of whistle-blowers from United Nations system organizations who have gone public for a variety of reasons, including a perceived lack of adequate action by their organization in response to their initial reporting of misconduct and\/or retaliation,&rdquo; the Joint Inspection Unit said in a 110-page report. In February 2018, the deputy head of the U.N. agency for HIV\/AIDS did not seek to renew his term, although a sexual harassment allegation against him had been dismissed as unsubstantiated. A deputy director at the U.N. Children&rsquo;s Fund resigned saying he did not want coverage of his past mistakes to damage UNICEF. The inspectors evaluated practices at 28 U.N. agencies and interviewed with more than 400 people, including 17 people who had reported wrongdoing, and conducted staff surveys. Among survey respondents, some 53 per cent of those who had witnessed misconduct or wrongdoing within the past five years had not reported it. Many did not do so &ldquo;because they lacked confidence that confidentiality would be fully respected and that they would be effectively protected if they did report&rdquo;. Ensuring anonymity and confidentiality were essential, especially given the hierarchical nature of the world body where a growing proportion of the workforce lack job security, the report said. All agencies should have explicit provisions for reporting misconduct against the head of the organization and the  head of oversight to an independent channel, it added. Only three agencies had such provisions at the moment, it said. Currently &ldquo;not a single organization&rsquo;s policy fully met the requirements of all five best practices criteria&rdquo;, according to the report.

Maduro, whose approval ratings hover around 25 percent, with opponents blaming his policies for worsening an economic meltdown, has called government supporters to unite in the face of what he described as right-wing plots led by the neighboring Colombian government and exiles in the United States. Colombia&rsquo;s President Juan Manuel Santos has scoffed at the accusations, saying he was fully focused on his granddaughter&rsquo;s baptism on Saturday, while U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said Washington was not involved in the blast. Supporters wearing t-shirts emblazoned with Maduro&rsquo;s face massed in Caracas on Monday, with the president due to address the crowd from the Miraflores palace in the afternoon. &ldquo;Us workers are here to support the president. Nothing like that had ever happened on live television before, there is no justification for this attack against the president,&rdquo; said Melanie Diaz, 40, who works at the Food Ministry.  But turnout was thin at a few hundred supporters, many of them government employees, with some of them saying they had been ordered to attend, according to Reuters witnesses. Many Venezuelans who adored late leader Hugo Chavez have soured on Maduro, his far less charismatic successor.  &ldquo;Today they told us we had to come support Maduro because of what happened on Saturday,&rdquo; said Maria Berrios, 60, who works at the National Institute of Urban Territory. Venezuela&rsquo;s government said suspects launched two DJI M600 drones laden with C4 explosives over an outdoor rally Maduro was holding in downtown Caracas to commemorate the founding of the National Guard on Saturday. One was &ldquo;diverted&rdquo; by security forces while the second fell on its own and hit an apartment building, authorities said. The attack highlights Maduro&rsquo;s challenges in maintaining control over the OPEC nation, where widespread food and medicine shortages have fueled outrage and despair everywhere from hillside slums to military barracks.

Washington is poised to hit Tehran with the economic sanctions after President Donald Trump in May exited a nuclear pact between Tehran and major world powers.  His decision requires most companies to complete ongoing business with Iran before U.S. sanctions are reimposed after a wind-down period which expires on Aug. 6. ATR has now delivered 13 of the aircraft sought by IranAir and another seven remain on order.  &ldquo;The next step will consist in working on getting an appropriate authorization from the U.S. administration to ensure a reasonable level of maintenance,&rdquo; ATR said in a statement. &ldquo;We still have challenges to face with the remaining aircraft originally intended for Iran,&rdquo; the planemaker added. &ldquo;We will dedicate the remaining part of the year to execute our plans as foreseen.&rdquo;  All five new ATR 72-600 planes landed in Tehran&rsquo;s Mehrabad airport after leaving Toulouse, France, where they were built, and refueling in Urmia in northwestern Iran, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported. ATR - co-owned by Airbus and Italy&rsquo;s Leonardo - has been pressing U.S. authorities to allow it to deliver aircraft it built for Iran. After the signing of the accord in 2015 to reopen trade links in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear activities, IranAir ordered a total of 200 aircraft from Western planemakers including 20 from ATR, which is based in Toulouse. FINANCIAL DAMAGE Few, however, have been delivered and planemakers say they are unable to use the wind-down period because Washington has also revoked export licenses needed by all Western planemakers due to their heavy use of U.S. parts. ATR lobbied the U.S. Treasury to allow it to take advantage of the normal wind-down period for Iran business by giving it temporary new licenses.  Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan, an adviser to Iran&rsquo;s transport minister, was quoted by the semi-official news agency ILNA as saying that Iran had paid for the five planes on Friday, a day before the planes left France.  &ldquo;The delivery of these five aircraft is a sign of Europe&rsquo;s commitment to the nuclear accord,&rdquo; Fakhrieh-Kashan told ILNA. The U.S. decision on Iran has raised question marks over whether ATR can reach a target of stabilizing annual deliveries at 80 aircraft in 2018.  The planemaker has said it will suffer financial damage if it cannot deliver the aircraft it has already produced following earlier U.S. approvals, and is looking for alternative buyers. Airbus said last month it would not attempt to deliver any more planes to Iran in the wind-down period. It has delivered just three of 100 ordered by IranAir. Boeing, which had sold 80 jets to IranAir under the 2015 nuclear deal, does not plan any deliveries. Unlike the European firms, it never placed the Iranian deal in its official order book on the grounds that it never received a deposit.

Witnesses said federal troops deployed in the province&rsquo;s capital Jijiga on Friday and one journalist said they wanted to arrest regional officials.  But their presence sparked violence in several towns and crowds looted and burned property and shops owned by ethnic minorities in Jijiga. The attacks forced thousands to seek refuge in an Ethiopian Orthodox church since Friday, residents told Reuters. On Monday, some of them staged a protest. &ldquo;They blocked a road surrounding the church to demonstrate, before security forces arrived and began firing indiscriminately,&rdquo; said an employee for an international organization who lives in the town told Reuters. The employee, who declined to be named, said he saw four bodies on the ground after the crowd was dispersed, and that gunfire rung out throughout the day. At least two Ethiopian Orthodox churches were also burned down over the weekend, witnesses told Reuters.  It was not immediately clear why central authorities deployed troops. Residents said some soldiers were deployed outside the offices of regional officials in an attempt to arrest them.  Government officials in Addis Ababa and Jijiga were not reachable for comment. On Saturday, Ethiopia&rsquo;s defense ministry confirmed the deployment of soldiers. &ldquo;The violence has not been halted despite attempts by defense forces and other security forces to restore calm,&rdquo; the ministry said in a statement.  &ldquo;Hence, as the region&rsquo;s peace and security has come under threat, our defense forces will not remain silent in the face of unrest and chaos and will take necessary measures in accordance with constitutional obligations,&rdquo; the statement said. The Somali region has seen sporadic violence for three decades. The government has fought the rebel Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) since 1984 after the group launched a bid for secession of the province, also known as Ogaden.  Since 2017, clashes along its border with Oromiya province have displaced tens of thousands of people.  In July, the region&rsquo;s officials were accused by the government in Addis Ababa of perpetrating rights abuses.

The fire has injured 25 people and spread quickly over the weekend as a heatwave swept large parts of Europe. Authorities had hoped to control the blaze during the day as temperatures fell slightly, but instead it flared up again. &ldquo;Mountains are still burning. Nothing is under control,&rdquo; said Eulalia Nunes, 46, a music teacher in Monchique. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a horror movie, with sparks falling everywhere. The sky is cloudy and full of smoke and ash in every corner.&rdquo; Temperatures reached a peak of nearly 47 degrees Celsius (116 Fahrenheit) on Sunday, and it remains extremely hot in most of Portugal. Authorities have kept sending more firefighters to Monchique over the past 24 hours, with 1,158 mobilized by Monday afternoon. The army sent 160 soldiers to help with evacuations.  The village of Foia was evacuated on Monday, with authorities taking no chances in a country which had its worst fires in history last year that killed 114 people.  The fire is burning through eucalyptus and pine forests in the hills above the Algarve coast, an area popular with tourists for its hot springs. Two well-known hotels in the village of Monchique were evacuated and closed on Sunday. The smoke from the fire could be seen from the coast. Twenty four people have been treated for light burns and smoke inhalation while one person suffered more serious burns.     While many people were evacuated, Joao Furtado, 60, was forced to hide in a water tank to escape the flames as his house burnt down during the night, according to his sister-in-law. &ldquo;He was panicking because he was trapped in the house,&rdquo; said Maria Helena Furtado. &ldquo;There was fire everywhere and he couldn&rsquo;t get out.&rdquo; Spain sent three Canadair firefighting planes, bringing a total of 13 aircraft that were dumping water on the flames. Jorge Botelho, head of civil protection in the region, said between 15,000 hectares and 20,000 hectares of forest had burnt - an area much greater than the size of the capital Lisbon itself.  Authorities have gone to great lengths to ensure there was no repeat of last year&rsquo;s tragedies, when two deadly fires struck Portugal in June and October, killing a total of 114 people, after an extended drought and hot weather.  Hundreds of new firefighters have been hired and efforts made to clear flammable undergrowth from forests. Until the heatwave this had largely worked, partly as the summer had been unusually cold and wet.

Medvedev&rsquo;s comments comes weeks after President Vladimir Putin warned NATO against cultivating closer ties with Ukraine and Georgia, saying such a policy was irresponsible and would have unspecified consequences for the alliance. &ldquo;It (Georgia&rsquo;s entry to NATO) could provoke a terrible conflict. It&rsquo;s not clear why this is needed,&rdquo; Medvedev told Russia&rsquo;s Kommersant FM radio station, which broadcast fragments of an interview with him on Monday. Georgia&rsquo;s NATO ambitions have been a source of anger for Russia \u2014 which shares a border with ex-Soviet republic Georgia and does not want to see it join what it regards as a hostile military bloc \u2014 since 2008 when NATO leaders promised Georgia it would one day join the alliance.  Russian forces entered two breakaway Georgian regions in 2008, which remain garrisoned by Russian troops to this day, something Moscow says is in keeping with local people&rsquo;s wishes, but which the West and the Georgian government calls an illegal occupation. NATO leaders discussed ties with Georgia at their summit in Brussels in July.

Medvedev&rsquo;s comments comes weeks after President Vladimir Putin warned NATO against cultivating closer ties with Ukraine and Georgia, saying such a policy was irresponsible and would have unspecified consequences for the alliance. &ldquo;It (Georgia&rsquo;s entry to NATO) could provoke a terrible conflict. It&rsquo;s not clear why this is needed,&rdquo; Medvedev told Russia&rsquo;s Kommersant FM radio station, which broadcast fragments of an interview with him on Monday. Georgia&rsquo;s NATO ambitions have been a source of anger for Russia \u2014 which shares a border with ex-Soviet republic Georgia and does not want to see it join what it regards as a hostile military bloc \u2014 since 2008 when NATO leaders promised Georgia it would one day join the alliance.  Russian forces entered two breakaway Georgian regions in 2008, which remain garrisoned by Russian troops to this day, something Moscow says is in keeping with local people&rsquo;s wishes, but which the West and the Georgian government calls an illegal occupation.

SoftBank, which is planning to list its domestic telecoms business, also said profit was bolstered by the sale of most of the Chinese operations of chip design unit ARM Holdings. The sales are the first signs of SoftBank monetizing its investments after pumping billions of dollars into technology companies around the world yet taking little profit. Its Vision Fund is the world&rsquo;s largest private equity fund, raising over $93 billion at its first major close in May last year. The fund, which is yet to complete its final close, had invested $27.1 billion in 29 firms as at June-end, SoftBank said on Monday. Its investments are now worth $32.5 billion on the rising value of its various stakes such as in shared office space company WeWork Cos. SoftBank has around 1,700 of its own staff currently using some of WeWork Japan&rsquo;s 6,250 seats. &ldquo;We are considering moving all of SoftBank&rsquo;s headquarters into WeWork (offices) in the near future,&rdquo; Chief Executive Masayoshi Son said on Monday. Son has previously said a second Vision Fund is being planned, but on Monday declined to comment on timing or size. TELECOMS IPO SoftBank, which is increasingly shifting focusing to investment activity from its telecoms business, also reported rising values from stakes in U.S. ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and Southeast Asian peer Grab. Amid its effort to switch focus, SoftBank is planning to list its Japan telecoms unit in what is widely expected to be one of the country&rsquo;s largest-ever initial public offerings. SoftBank is planning to seek a valuation of about $90 billion for the unit, Bloomberg reported here on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. The listing of the unit could happen as early as the fourth quarter, according to the report. The plans come as e-commerce firm Rakuten Inc prepares to become Japan&rsquo;s fourth wireless carrier next year, potentially adding pressure to SoftBank&rsquo;s telecom earnings. In April-June, the unit booked a 0.7 percent increase in operating profit on sales which grew 4.6 percent. Group-wide first-quarter profit rose to 715 billion yen ($6.42 billion) from 479 billion yen a year earlier, SoftBank said. It did not release a forecast for the current business year ending March, saying there were too many uncertain factors. SoftBank&rsquo;s shares closed up 2 percent ahead of the earnings announcement. The stock is currently up 6 percent year-to-date.

The so-called snapback sanctions, due to come into force early on Tuesday, will target Iranian purchases of U.S. dollars, metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector. Foes for decades, the United States and Iran have been increasingly at odds over Iran&rsquo;s growing political and military influence in the Middle East since Trump took office in January 2017. The sanctions now being brought back were among those lifted under a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran on curbing Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program.  Iran&rsquo;s rial currency has lost half its value since April under the threat of revived U.S. sanctions. The currency&rsquo;s collapse and soaring inflation have sparked sporadic demonstrations in Iran against profiteering and corruption, with     many protesters chanting anti-government slogans.    U.S. President Donald Trump, who abandoned the nuclear deal in May, is aiming to cut off the Iranian leadership&rsquo;s access to resources, officials said.  White House national security adviser John Bolton, who advocates a hard line against Iran, said on Monday Tehran should take up a recent offer from Trump to negotiate. &ldquo;They could take up the president&rsquo;s offer to negotiate with them, to give up their ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs fully and really verifiably,&rdquo; Bolton told Fox News. &ldquo;If the ayatollahs want to get out from under the squeeze,  they should come and sit down.

The European Union voiced regret on Monday at the looming U.S. sanctions. The United States also plans to re-introduce potentially more damaging sanctions on Iranian oil in November and wants as many countries as possible to cut their imports of Iranian oil to zero.  But a senior official at Iran&rsquo;s economy ministry said Tehran did not think the economic impact of the sanctions would be massive. &ldquo;Many countries, including Europeans, disagree with the U.S. sanctions and are willing to work with Iran,&rdquo; said the official, who asked not to be named.

The sanctions aim to modify Iran&rsquo;s behavior and not bring about a &ldquo;regime change&rdquo; targeting Rouhani, U.S. officials said on a conference call on Monday. They said the government&rsquo;s handling of social and labor protests was a concern.     Fear of sanctions and economic hardship have led to sporadic protests in several cities in recent days, with ordinary Iranians chanting slogans against Iranian leaders.       One U.S. official said the administration was deeply concerned about reports of violence against unarmed citizens. &ldquo;The United States supports the Iranian people&rsquo;s right to peacefully protest against corruption and oppression without fear of reprisal,&rdquo; the official added. Trump warned on Monday of &ldquo;severe consequences&rdquo; for people or entities that fail to wind down economic activities with Iran.  &ldquo;The United States is fully committed to enforcing all of our sanctions, and we will work closely with nations conducting business with Iran to ensure complete compliance,&rdquo; he said in a statement. The European Union vowed on Monday to counter the renewal of sanctions on Iran. The EU and other parties to the 2015 nuclear deal, China and Russia, are working to maintain trade with Iran, which has threatened to stop complying with curbs on its nuclear work if it fails to see the economic benefits of relief from sanctions under the deal. &ldquo;We deeply regret the reimposition of sanctions by the U.S.,&rdquo; the bloc said in a joint statement with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Britain. They pledged to work on preserving financial flows and Iran&rsquo;s oil and gas exports - a lifeline of its economy.

BuzzFeed earlier reported that Apple had removed the library for five of Jones&rsquo;s six Infowars podcasts, including the shows &ldquo;War Room&rdquo; and the daily &ldquo;The Alex Jones Show.&rdquo; Music and podcast company Spotify said on Monday that it had now removed all of Jones&rsquo;s Infowars programs from its platform, after last week removing some programs. A representative said that Spotify took seriously reports of hate content. &ldquo;Due to repeated violations of Spotify&rsquo;s prohibited content policies, The Alex Jones Show has lost access to the Spotify platform,&rdquo; the representative said. Facebook had earlier suspended the radio and Internet host&rsquo;s personal profile for 30 days in late July from its site for what the company said was bullying and hate speech. Jones has also promoted a theory that the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre was faked by left-wing forces to promote gun control. The shooting left 26 children and adults dead at a Connecticut elementary school. He is being sued in Texas by two Sandy Hook parents, seeking at least $1 million, claiming that they have been the subject of harassment driven by his programs.

(Reuters) - The trial of Paul Manafort, U.S. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s former campaign chairman, resumed on Monday with Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers facing a major test as they cross-examine an accountant who testified that she helped him prepare fraudulent tax returns. The federal trial jury in Alexandria, Virginia, had heard testimony on Friday from Cynthia Laporta, who described how Manafort and longtime business associate Rick Gates doctored financial statements and backdated loans. Gates himself is expected to testify against Manafort, his former boss, this week. It was not clear precisely when Gates, who is cooperating with an investigation by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, will be called to testify. Prosecutor Greg Andres walked into the courtroom with a binder labeled &ldquo;Richard Gates&rdquo; on Monday, the fifth day of the trial. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. The charges largely predate his five months on the Trump campaign. Since the trial started last Tuesday, Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers have kept their cross-examinations brief and at times refrained from attempting to rebut damaging testimony in detail. But Laporta&rsquo;s testimony raised the stakes for Manafort, legal experts said. Testifying under immunity, she was the first witness to admit she knew accounting maneuvers Manafort and Gates requested of her were wrong and could be crimes. One accounting trick saved Manafort $500,000 in taxes, she said.  David Axelrod, a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense attorney, said Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers need to hammer home that Laporta received immunity for providing potentially incriminating evidence against Manafort, and highlight her own admission that she went along with the accounting for fear of losing a lucrative client, an acknowledgement she lied for money.   &ldquo;You make her say &lsquo;I lied&rsquo; as many times as you can,&rdquo; Axelrod said. U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis told Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers on Friday they could dig into Laporta&rsquo;s immunity agreement on cross-examination. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re entitled to go into that in any detail you want to,&rdquo; he said. Laporta was the 14th witness called by Mueller, whose case against Manafort arose out of his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. The charges against Manafort do not address collusion, although a second trial set for September in Washington could reveal new information on that issue. &lsquo;SEPARATING GATES AND MANAFORT&rsquo; Laporta detailed multiple examples in which Manafort and Gates sought to doctor financial records, first in order to lower Manafort&rsquo;s taxable income and then later to inflate his income so that he could get bank loans. Some of the maneuvers were at the request of Gates, while others implicated Manafort, Laporta testified. In one instance Manafort&rsquo;s signature was on a loan agreement created in 2015 and inappropriately backdated for the 2014 tax year, she said. Similar to prior witnesses, Laporta testified that Gates and Manafort were in lockstep but that Manafort was in charge. Shanlon Wu, a\u00a0former attorney for Gates before he pleaded guilty in February and starting cooperating with Mueller, said Monday would be a critical test of the defense&rsquo;s strategy of pinning the wrongdoing on Gates. &ldquo;They must make headway in separating Gates and Manafort,&rdquo; Wu said. Wu said he was speaking as an observer now that he is no longer involved in the case. Laporta was one of five witnesses granted immunity for the trial. The other four include an insurance agent, two bankers who worked on mortgages for Manafort, and Conor O&rsquo;Brien, a former assistant to Laporta at the accounting firm KWC. Given the impact of Laporta&rsquo;s testimony, it is now unlikely the prosecution will call O&rsquo;Brien to the stand, according to a person close to the case. That could change if Laporta&rsquo;s credibility is undermined on cross-examination, the person said. While taking some of the sting out of Laporta&rsquo;s testimony could prove useful to the defense, the more important challenge will be undercutting Gates, who as part of his plea deal admitted to helping Manafort evade taxes and mislead banks to get him loans. Gates said he did so at Manafort&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;The real fireworks are going to come when Mr. Gates is on the stand and is crossed,&rdquo; said J. D.

The Milwaukee-based company, known for its heavy touring motorcycles, said last week it would launch a 250cc to 500cc motorcycle in India to boost sales in the world&rsquo;s largest two-wheeler market as it grapples with an aging customer base and falling sales in the United States. Industry sales are projected to grow 25 percent a year in Asia&rsquo;s third-largest economy in the 250cc to 500cc segment through 2021.  &ldquo;We realize that we as a company have been very focused on large heavyweight motorcycles and our expertise in the 250-500cc space needs to grow,&rdquo; Marc McAllister, vice president of product portfolio at Harley-Davidson, told Reuters in an telephone interview on Friday. &ldquo;We are looking for a strategic alliance that can help us grow through understanding the product, understanding the consumer, understanding the assembly,&rdquo; he said. That could mean Harley will not necessarily make the new motorcycles at its own facility in India, and may instead use a local partner, McAllister said. He declined to discuss names or details of potential partners. Helped by rising discretionary spending, motorcycles sales in India are experiencing double-digit percentage growth, compared with tepid recent consumer demand in the United States. Lured by the enticing growth prospects, British motorcycle maker Triumph and Germany&rsquo;s BMW (BMWG.DE ) have partnered with Indian companies Bajaj Auto (BAJA.NS ) and TVS Motor (TVSM.NS ), respectively. Harley expects the lightweight segment to act as a &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; to its brand, said McAllister, giving it a chance to make deeper inroads into a market where over 20 million two-wheelers are sold annually. The company had been criticized by U.S. President Donald Trump over a plan move production for European customers overseas to avoid retaliatory tariffs in a trade dispute between the United States and European Union.  Harley is hoping a foray into the lightweight segment, along with other new product launches, will expand its operating margins and add up to $250 million in operating profit in 2022. Analysts are sceptical of the profit targets as India is a highly cost-competitive market and lightweight bikes are historically lower-margin products. McAllister said the new bike will a premium product, but declined to reveal a price range. As part of its drive to increase market share in India, Harley said it will increase its number of dealers there from the current 30, McAllister said.

The deliberations make Mattress Firm the latest U.S. retailer struggling due to competition from e-commerce firms such as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O ) putting pressure on brick-and-mortar retailers. Mattress Firm&rsquo;s South African parent, Steinhoff International Holdings NV (SNHJ.J ), has been working on a deal to restructure the debt of some subsidiaries with its creditors, following an accounting scandal. Creditors agreed last month to hold off on their debt claims for three years.   Steinhoff acquired Mattress Firm for $3.8 billion in 2016.  Both Houston-headquartered Mattress Firm and Steinhoff are working with consulting firm AlixPartners LLP, the two sources said this week. AlixPartners helps companies plan and execute turnaround strategies, and is often brought in to lay the ground for bankruptcy. The sources, who requested not to be identified because the plans are private, cautioned that Mattress Firm has not made any final decisions and its plans could change. Representatives for Mattress Firm and AlixPartners declined to comment. Steinhoff did not respond to requests for comment.  Filing for bankruptcy would allow Mattress Firm to clean up its real estate portfolio and improve cash flow and profitability, analysts at Piper Jaffray Companies (PJC.N ) wrote in a research note last week. Many retailers pursue bankruptcy to reject leases, a move to slim their store count, cut their costs and reorganize to continue their business. U.S. discount footwear retailer Payless ShoeSource Inc, for example, closed roughly 700 mall-based stores in bankruptcy last year, while children&rsquo;s clothing shop Gymboree Corp closed about 300. To be sure, some retailers shut huge swaths of their store base outside of bankruptcy. Bebe stores Inc (BEBE.PK ) closed nearly all its retail locations without filing for bankruptcy last year, negotiating a deal with its landlords instead. Mattress Firm lost Tempur Sealy International Inc (TPX.N ), the maker of popular mattress brand Tempur-Pedic, as a supplier last year, limiting its offerings. Mattress Firm secured a $225 million asset-backed revolving loan last year.  Steinhoff booked a $12 billion write-down earlier this year relating to accounting irregularities. Steinhoff also owns discount chains Poundland in the United Kingdom and Ackermans in South Africa. Mattress Firm acquired HMK Mattress Holdings LLC, the parent company of competitor Sleepy&rsquo;s, in 2016 for $780 million and then rebranded the shops. Sleepy&rsquo;s had over 1,050 stores on the U.S. East Coast and Illinois.

Mattress Firm&rsquo;s South African parent, Steinhoff International Holdings NV (SNHJ.J ), has been working on a deal to restructure the debt of some subsidiaries with its creditors, following an accounting scandal. Creditors agreed last month to hold off on their debt claims for three years.   Steinhoff acquired Mattress Firm for $3.8 billion in 2016.  Both Houston-headquartered Mattress Firm and Steinhoff are working with consulting firm AlixPartners LLP, the two sources said this week. AlixPartners helps companies plan and execute turnaround strategies, and is often brought in to lay the ground for bankruptcy. The sources, who requested not to be identified because the plans are private, cautioned that Mattress Firm has not made any final decisions and its plans could change. Representatives for Mattress Firm and AlixPartners declined to comment. Steinhoff did not respond to requests for comment.  Filing for bankruptcy would allow Mattress Firm to clean up its real estate portfolio and improve cash flow and profitability, analysts at Piper Jaffray Companies (PJC.N ) wrote in a research note last week. Many retailers pursue bankruptcy to reject leases, a move to slim their store count, cut their costs and reorganize to continue their business. U.S. discount footwear retailer Payless ShoeSource Inc, for example, closed roughly 700 mall-based stores in bankruptcy last year, while children&rsquo;s clothing shop Gymboree Corp closed about 300. To be sure, some retailers shut huge swaths of their store base outside of bankruptcy. Bebe stores Inc (BEBE.PK ) closed nearly all its retail locations without filing for bankruptcy last year, negotiating a deal with its landlords instead. Mattress Firm lost Tempur Sealy International Inc (TPX.N ), the maker of popular mattress brand Tempur-Pedic, as a supplier last year, limiting its offerings. Mattress Firm secured a $225 million asset-backed revolving loan last year.  Steinhoff booked a $12 billion write-down earlier this year relating to accounting irregularities. Steinhoff also owns discount chains Poundland in the United Kingdom and Ackermans in South Africa. Mattress Firm acquired HMK Mattress Holdings LLC, the parent company of competitor Sleepy&rsquo;s, in 2016 for $780 million and then rebranded the shops. Sleepy&rsquo;s had over 1,050 stores on the U.S. East Coast and Illinois.

(Reuters) - The longtime business partner of Paul Manafort, U.S. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s former campaign chairman, will begin his testimony for the government at Manafort&rsquo;s trial on fraud charges later on  Monday, a defense lawyer said. The federal trial jury in Alexandria, Virginia, had heard testimony on Friday from Cynthia Laporta, who described how Manafort and his associate Rick Gates doctored financial statements and backdated loans. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. The charges largely predate his five months on the Trump campaign but arose from U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Related CoverageFormer Manafort partner Gates to testify next in fraud trial Manafort lawyer Kevin Downing said Gates would be the next witness called. Prosecutor Greg Andres walked into the courtroom with a binder labeled &ldquo;Richard Gates&rdquo; earlier on Monday, the fifth day of the trial. Gates is expected to be a star witness in the government&rsquo;s case because of his long association with Manafort. Since the trial started last Tuesday, Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers have kept their cross-examinations brief and at times refrained from attempting to rebut damaging testimony in detail. But Laporta&rsquo;s testimony raised the stakes for Manafort, legal experts said. Testifying under immunity, she was the first witness to admit she knew accounting maneuvers Manafort and Gates requested of her were wrong and could be crimes. One accounting trick saved Manafort $500,000 in taxes, she said.  Laporta was the 14th witness called by prosecutors before U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis. Mueller is also investigating possible coordination between Trump campaign members and Russian officials, but the charges against Manafort do not address that.

REUTERS\/Yuri Gripas\/File Photo Laporta detailed multiple examples in which Manafort and Gates sought to doctor financial records, first in order to lower Manafort&rsquo;s taxable income and then later to inflate his income so that he could get bank loans. Some of the maneuvers were at the request of Gates, while others implicated Manafort, Laporta testified. In one instance Manafort&rsquo;s signature was on a loan agreement created in 2015 and inappropriately backdated for the 2014 tax year, she said. Similar to prior witnesses, Laporta testified that Gates and Manafort were in lockstep but that Manafort was in charge. The jury has heard how Manafort made tens of millions of dollars for political work with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine.  Shanlon Wu, a\u00a0former attorney for Gates before he pleaded guilty in February and starting cooperating with Mueller, said Monday would be a critical test of the defense&rsquo;s strategy of pinning the wrongdoing on Gates. &ldquo;They must make headway in separating Gates and Manafort,&rdquo; Wu said. Wu said he was speaking as an observer now that he is no longer involved in the case.

"},"56bda35423a4ef2c3dbe9dcf6ff6cf76":{"title":"Jailed Bahraini opposition leader denied medical treatment: son","text":"LONDON (Reuters) - Bahraini opposition leader Hassan Mushaima is being denied vital medical care in jail in the Gulf state, says his son Ali Mushaima, on hunger strike outside Bahrain&rsquo;s London embassy. Hassan Mushaima, 70, was arrested in 2011 along with other Shi&rsquo;ite activists and opposition figures and sentenced to life in prison for leading anti-government protests that year at the height of the region&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arab Spring&rdquo; uprisings. Amnesty International on Monday also accused Bahraini authorities of failing to provide proper medical care for Mushaima and three other elderly jailed activists for over a year. &ldquo;They are killing my father slowly, because when you are denying a 70-year-old man his medicine, his body will not take it,&rdquo; said Ali Mushaima, sitting on a thin mattress on the pavement in front of the Bahrain Embassy, where he began his vigil on August 1. Mushaima said his father had been treated for cancer several years ago, and needed regular check-ups to ensure the disease had not returned. He said his father also suffered from high blood pressure, diabetes and a urinary tract infection. His medication is running out and authorities had not supplied him with new pills, Ali said. Bahraini officials did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Bahraini embassy in London last week denied Mushaima was being mistreated, saying he had been to the prison medical clinic 16 times since the beginning of 2018. The embassy said &ldquo;he continues to receive medical attention, along with his prescribed medications and a special diet as part of his medical regime.&rdquo; The embassy said Mushaima had been diagnosed with cancer 10 years ago. Since his conviction in 2012, arrangements had been made for scans every six months, it said.  &ldquo;However, Mr Mushaima refused to attend these scans on both occasions last year,&rdquo; it said on its Twitter account.  His son told Reuters: &ldquo;They want to humiliate my father by putting handcuffs and shackles on his hands and feet, and he is saying I am not going to hospital or to see my family like this.&rdquo; SHI&rsquo;ITE MAJORITY, SUNNI RULERS Western-allied Bahrain, where the U.S. Fifth Fleet is based, crushed mass protests by the Shi&rsquo;ite Muslim majority in 2011. The ruling Sunni Al Khalifa family has kept a lid on unrest since then by closing Shi&rsquo;ite-led opposition groups and prosecuting activists. Bahrain&rsquo;s rulers have refused to make power-sharing concessions to the Shi&rsquo;ites, seen by the authorities and Sunni Arab neighbors including Saudi Arabia as proxies for non-Arab Shi&rsquo;ite rival Iran. Authorities in Bahrain have convicted scores of people of terrorism in a series of mass trials. Rights activists say they are mostly peaceful opposition activists. &ldquo;The Bahraini authorities&rsquo; treatment of these wrongfully imprisoned peaceful activists violates international law and standards on prisoner treatment and constitutes cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment,&rdquo; said Lynn Maalouf, Middle East Research Director at Amnesty International. Demonstrators have clashed frequently with security forces, who have been targeted by bomb attacks. Bahrain has accused the opposition of undermining security and blamed the bombings on Iran and Lebanon&rsquo;s armed Shi&rsquo;ite group Hezbollah. Iran and Hezbollah deny any involvement in Bahrain&rsquo;s unrest.  Ali Mushaima has been in London since 2006. He said he had been sentenced by Bahrain courts in absentia to 45 years in jail and his citizenship had been revoked. He told Reuters that he began his hunger strike last week to raise awareness of his father&rsquo;s plight.  &ldquo;I have lost five kilos. I am drinking, but I am not eating. My demand is very simple ... I am talking about medical care, family visits and access to books.&rdquo; He criticized the U.S. and British governments for not pressuring Bahrain over the crackdown, saying the British government was &ldquo;indirectly&rdquo; responsible since it &ldquo;trained the Bahraini police officers and provided technical assistance&rdquo;. A spokesperson for Britain&rsquo;s Foreign and Commonwealth Office told Reuters on Monday: &ldquo;We believe that only by working with Bahrain can we hope to bring about the changes we would like to see.&rdquo;  Britain opened a permanent military base in Bahrain in April in an attempt to boost its role as a major player in the region.

CBS shares were down 0.5 percent at $52.87 on Monday.  The company&rsquo;s shares have lost about 8 percent of their value since July 26, the day before the New Yorker magazine published an article containing allegations of sexual harassment against Moonves by six women ranging from 1985 to 2006.  Moonves has said that he &ldquo;may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances&rdquo; decades ago, which he called mistakes that he regretted immensely, but that he understood &ldquo;&lsquo;no&rsquo; means &lsquo;no&rsquo;&rdquo; and had never used his position to harm anyone&rsquo;s career. Last week CBS hired two law firms to investigate the allegations against Moonves. Among Wall Street analysts, the mean price target for CBS stock is $65.04, down only slightly from $65.88 on July 6.     Some analysts cited a &ldquo;generally solid&rdquo; second quarter after CBS results topped Wall Street estimates Aug. 2. But they also refer to the Moonves investigation as a big overhang on the stock.  MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson, who has a &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; rating on CBS and a price target of $58, said it is &ldquo;uninvestable&rdquo; and that &ldquo;if these accusations are correct, it would be impossible for Moonves to continue&rdquo; as CEO. B. Riley&rsquo;s Barton Crockett, who rates CBS as a &ldquo;buy&rdquo; and has a $61 price target on the stock, refers to the Moonves situation as a &ldquo;sideshow drama.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Every media company that&rsquo;s lost top execs\/talent to #MeToo has continued apace, because of other talent\/management stepping up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;CBS, we believe, would, too.&rdquo; The investigation of Moonves comes as CBS is locked in a legal battle with its largest shareholder, Shari Redstone&rsquo;s National Amusements Inc. Moonves has opposed Redstone&rsquo;s efforts to merge CBS with Viacom Inc (VIAB.O ), also owned by National Amusements.  Benchmark Co&rsquo;s Daniel Kurnos, who has a &ldquo;buy&rdquo; rating and a  $90 price target headlined his research note: &ldquo;Legal Distractions Aside, Plenty of Intrinsic Fundamental Value for CBS.&rdquo;  Kurnos said that while he acknowledges CBS is &ldquo;difficult to buy ahead of a resolution of the impending legal challenges&rdquo; he also cited it as leading content provider with increasing proportion of recurring or subscription revenue.

The United States has demanded tougher rules of origin, particularly on what percentage of a car needs to be built in the NAFTA region to avoid tariffs than outlined in the current trade deal. &ldquo;We have a proposal on the table, we&rsquo;re analyzing some characteristics of the U.S. position, and we&rsquo;re doing it clearly in line with our dialogue with Mexico&rsquo;s auto industry,&rdquo; Guajardo told reporters after an event in Mexico City.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who launched the renegotiation of the 1994 pact a year ago, has said he wants the reworked deal to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States.     Guajardo on Monday also said that Canada, which is not participating in U.S.-Mexico talks that began in Washington two weeks ago after months of negotiations between the three trade partners, could join next week, depending on progress in the next few days between Mexico and the United States.  The bilateral meetings have yielded important developments, Guajardo said, adding that he will return to Washington midweek. He did not give details.  Mexican sources briefed on the negotiations have said Mexico has offered to raise the threshold for regional content beyond a May proposal of 70 percent, up from the current level of 62.5 percent. The United States is seeking 75 percent as well as demanding a proportion of vehicles be made in factories paying $16 an hour or more.  Mexico&rsquo;s El Economista financial newspaper on Monday reported that Mexico had agreed to those demands, in return for a five-year transition period. Asked about the reports, Mexico&rsquo;s chief trade negotiator Kenneth Smith said that no deal on autos had yet been reached. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t closed or resolved this chapter yet,&rdquo; Smith told reporters after the same event in Mexico City, saying that Canada also needed to take part before negotiators could reach final decisions.  Smith said Mexico and the United States were discussing technical details and each other&rsquo;s proposals involving the auto sector, and that Mexico was explaining the areas it considered particularly sensitive.  He also said Mexico would not budge on its rejection of U.S. bids for seasonal restrictions on fresh products or a sunset clause that could strike down NAFTA agreements after five years.

The United States has demanded tougher rules of origin, particularly on what percentage of a car needs to be built in the NAFTA region to avoid tariffs than outlined in the current trade deal. &ldquo;We have a proposal on the table, we&rsquo;re analyzing some characteristics of the U.S. position, and we&rsquo;re doing it clearly in line with our dialogue with Mexico&rsquo;s auto industry,&rdquo; Guajardo told reporters after an event in Mexico City.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who launched the renegotiation of the 1994 pact a year ago, has said he wants the reworked deal to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States.     Guajardo on Monday also said that Canada, which is not participating in U.S.-Mexico talks that began in Washington two weeks ago after months of negotiations between the three trade partners, could join next week, depending on progress in the next few days between Mexico and the United States.  The bilateral meetings have yielded important developments, Guajardo said, adding that he will return to Washington midweek. He did not give details.  Mexican sources briefed on the negotiations have said Mexico has offered to raise the threshold for regional content beyond a May proposal of 70 percent, up from the current level of 62.5 percent. The United States is seeking 75 percent as well as demanding a proportion of vehicles be made in factories paying $16 an hour or more.  Mexico&rsquo;s El Economista financial newspaper on Monday reported that Mexico had agreed to those demands, in return for a five-year transition period. Asked about the reports, Mexico&rsquo;s chief trade negotiator Kenneth Smith said that no deal on autos had yet been reached. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t closed or resolved this chapter yet,&rdquo; Smith told reporters after the same event in Mexico City, saying that Canada also needed to take part before negotiators could reach final decisions.  Smith said Mexico and the United States were discussing technical details and each other&rsquo;s proposals involving the auto sector, and that Mexico was explaining the areas it considered particularly sensitive.  He also said Mexico would not budge on its rejection of U.S. bids for seasonal restrictions on fresh products or a sunset clause that could strike down NAFTA agreements after five years.

Stronger demand for beef offset weaker results in Tyson&rsquo;s pork and chicken units, which the company said were hurt by trade disputes between the United States and major importers such as Mexico and China. Tyson shares rose 2.6 percent to $59.28 in afternoon trading, but are still down 27 percent for the year.

Tyson last week cut its full-year profit forecast, citing uncertainty in trade policies and tariffs from importers.

Hours before revived U.S. sanctions were due to kick in, White House national security adviser John Bolton said Iran should pay heed to Trump&rsquo;s willingness to negotiate. &ldquo;They could take up the president&rsquo;s offer to negotiate with them, to give up their ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs fully and really verifiably,&rdquo; Bolton told Fox News. &ldquo;If the ayatollahs want to get out from under the squeeze,  they should come and sit down. The pressure will not relent while the negotiations go on,&rdquo; said Bolton, one of the administration&rsquo;s main hawks on Iran. So-called snapback sanctions, due to come into force early on Tuesday, target Iranian purchases of U.S. dollars, metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector. Foes for decades, the United States and Iran have been increasingly at odds over Iran&rsquo;s growing political and military influence in the Middle East since Trump took office in January 2017. The renewed sanctions were among those lifted under a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran on curbing Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program. Trump abandoned the deal in May. Heavier U.S. sanctions, aimed at Iran&rsquo;s oil sector, are due in November. Iran&rsquo;s rial currency has lost half its value since April under the threat of revived U.S. sanctions. The currency&rsquo;s collapse and soaring inflation have sparked sporadic demonstrations in Iran against profiteering and corruption, with     many protesters chanting anti-government slogans.    President Hassan Rouhani on Monday said Iran could hold talks with the United States only if Washington proved its trustworthiness. Related CoverageIran&#x27;s Rouhani dismisses Trump call for talks on eve of new sanctions ATR delivers five more planes to IranAir, needs maintenance approvals EU aims to block U.S. sanctions on Iran Rouhani implied that if the United States signed up again to the nuclear deal and lifted sanctions, then that could pave the ground for negotiations. &ldquo;If you stab someone with a knife and then you say you want talks, then the first thing you have to do is remove the knife,&rdquo; Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television. &ldquo;We are always in favor of diplomacy and talks. ... But talks need honesty,&rdquo; Rouhani said. He called on Iranians to unite in the face of hardship. &ldquo;There will be pressure because of sanctions, but we will overcome this with unity,&rdquo; he said. Trump pulled the United States out of the nuclear deal, saying it fails to address Iran&rsquo;s ballistic missile program, the terms by which inspectors visit suspect Iranian nuclear sites, and &ldquo;sunset&rdquo; clauses under which some of its terms expire. The two countries are also in dispute over Iran&rsquo;s involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts from Yemen to Syria and tensions between Tehran and Israel. SANCTIONS WEAK SPOTS     Trump plans to reintroduce more damaging sanctions on Iranian oil in November and wants as many countries as possible to cut their imports of Iranian oil to zero. But the U.S. sanctions strategy has several weak spots, especially a reluctance by Europe and China to curtail business with Iran. The European Union voiced regret on Monday at the looming U.S. sanctions. A senior official at Iran&rsquo;s economy ministry said Tehran did not think the economic impact of the sanctions would be &ldquo;massive.&rdquo; &ldquo;Many countries, including Europeans, disagree with the U.S. sanctions and are willing to work with Iran,&rdquo; said the official, who asked not to be named. Iran said on Sunday it will ease foreign exchange rules, to try to halt the fall of its currency. Iran&rsquo;s net official reserves are projected to decline this year to $97.8 billion, enough to finance about 13 months of imports, the International Monetary Fund estimated in March.      The sanctions aim to modify Iran&rsquo;s behavior and not bring about a &ldquo;regime change&rdquo; targeting Rouhani, U.S. officials said on a conference call on Monday. They said the government&rsquo;s handling of social and labor protests was a concern.   Fear of sanctions and economic hardship have led to sporadic protests in several cities in recent days, with ordinary Iranians chanting slogans against Iranian leaders. Trump warned on Monday of &ldquo;severe consequences&rdquo; for people or entities that fail to wind down economic activities with Iran. &ldquo;The United States is fully committed to enforcing all of our sanctions, and we will work closely with nations conducting business with Iran to ensure complete compliance,&rdquo; he said in a statement. The European Union vowed on Monday to counter the renewal of sanctions on Iran. The EU and other parties to the 2015 nuclear deal, China and Russia, are working to maintain trade with Iran, which has threatened to stop complying with curbs on its nuclear work if it fails to see the economic benefits of relief from sanctions under the deal. &ldquo;We deeply regret the reimposition of sanctions by the U.S.,&rdquo; the bloc said in a joint statement with the foreign ministers of France, Germany and Britain.

The federal trial jury in Alexandria, Virginia, had heard testimony on Friday and Monday from accountant Cynthia Laporta, who described how Manafort and his associate Rick Gates doctored financial statements and backdated loans. Gates is expected to be a star witness in the government&rsquo;s case, having pleaded guilty in February and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors under a deal that could lead to a reduced sentence.

Related CoverageFormer Manafort partner Rick Gates takes stand in Manafort trial Manafort accountant asked at trial about loan from Russian oligarch Manafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. The charges largely predate his five months on the Trump campaign but were the first to arise from Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The jury has heard how Manafort made tens of millions of dollars for political work with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Gates was Manafort&rsquo;s partner in the consultancy. Mueller is also investigating possible coordination between Trump campaign members and Russian officials in the election campaign, but the charges against Manafort do not address that. In questioning Laporta on Monday, a prosecutor asked the accountant about a $10 million loan purportedly received by Manafort from Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska in 2006. Laporta, looking at a summary of loans to Manafort and his businesses, said she could not see any indication that the loan from Deripaska had been paid off.

Argentina is by far the largest buyer of Brazilian cars. But economists now expect Argentina to suffer a recession this year after a run on the peso currency prompted the government to hike interest rates and turn to the International Monetary Fund for a $50 billion stand-by credit. Overall, Brazilian auto exports are down 2.8 percent so far in 2018.  &ldquo;We are still predicting stability ... but now with some risk,&rdquo; Antonio Megale, the president of the association known as Anfavea said during Anfavea&rsquo;s monthly results conference. Megale added that Latin American markets are volatile and can have reversals both positive and negative Until last month, Anfavea had predicted exports would go up in 2018, but this is the second month that the association is predicting the year will ultimately end up being flat.  Automobile production in Brazil fell 4.1 percent BRAOPM=ECI in July from the previous month, while sales rose 7.7 percent BRASLM=ECI to their highest level since December 2015, Anfavea said. Production numbers are usually considered a better gauge of the market outlook.  Automakers in Brazil produced around 245,800 new cars and trucks last month, while sales totaled about 217,500 vehicles. Compared to a year ago, auto output rose 9.3 percent and sales jumped 17.7 percent.

Trump announced on March 23 that he would endorse a plan by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to restrict the military service of transgender people who experience a condition called gender dysphoria. The policy replaced an outright ban on transgender service members that Trump announced last year on Twitter, citing concern over military focus and medical costs.  U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington denied a request by the administration to lift an injunction she had issued against Trump&rsquo;s original ban.

Salameh, in an interview with Reuters, said the central bank was not concerned about the pound - pegged at its current level since 1997 - despite &ldquo;a lot of rumors&rdquo;. &ldquo;We are looking at stability on the monetary side and that stability will be reinforced if the reforms are initiated in order to bring down the budget deficit,&rdquo; said Salameh, who has been in the job for 25 years. Lebanon has the third largest debt-to-GDP ratio in the world, touching more than 150 percent at the end of 2017, according to the International Monetary Fund. The IMF said in June Lebanon was in need of &ldquo;an immediate and substantial fiscal adjustment&rdquo; to improve debt sustainability. Following an election in May, donor states are hoping for a new government that will bring down the deficit. But while Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri has vowed to implement reforms, talks on forming a new unity government have hit an impasse. Politicians have warned Lebanon faces an economic crisis. Lebanon's Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh reacts, as he speaks during an interview with Reuters in Beirut, Lebanon August 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Mohamed Azakir Salameh said it was not true that Lebanon was heading for a financial crisis, adding that there were rumors which aimed &ldquo;to create fear&rdquo; and &ldquo;decrease confidence in stability&rdquo;. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who is behind them.&rdquo; &ldquo;CRITICAL ROLE&rdquo; The central bank&rsquo;s foreign assets stand at more than $44 billion, up from $42 billion at the end of 2017. Bank deposits are expected to go up by between 4 percent and 5 percent this year, which Salameh called &ldquo;acceptable for Lebanon&rdquo;.     Remittances, a pillar of the economy, are stable. Non-performing loans were also at a stable 3.5 percent, he said. Salameh said last month he expected bank lending to fall by 1.6 percent in 2018 on last year. &ldquo;If there is a slowdown, it is related to lower growth in the economy and not to liquidity,&rdquo; he said.     Lebanon's Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh gestures, as he speaks during an interview with Reuters in Beirut, Lebanon August 6, 2018. REUTERS\/Mohamed Azakir The IMF has estimated economic growth of 1-1.5 percent in 2017 and 2018. In a June statement, the IMF Executive Board said the traditional drivers of growth in Lebanon - real estate and construction - were weak and a strong rebound unlikely soon. The central bank has forecast 2 percent growth this year. The IMF board commended the central bank for its &ldquo;critical role in attracting deposit inflows and effectively managing the difficult situation&rdquo;.  Asked about the interest rate outlook, Salameh said current rates were &ldquo;proper&rdquo; and still provided depositors with a return after an inflation rate of around 5 percent for the year was taken into account. Private sector banks were offering higher yields to increase their deposits in Lebanese pounds, he said. In May, the government completed a $5.5 billion debt swap with the central bank, issuing Eurobonds to the central bank in exchange for Lebanese pound T Bills.  Asked if there were plans for a further swap, Salameh said: &ldquo;No we don&rsquo;t have this intention because our balance of payments is behaving relatively well. We would have hoped for more surplus. We have a slight deficit, but not to the extent that warrants a new swap operation.&rdquo; "},"6cac1e43b6171c58645f339ef94dad89":{"title":"Global stocks lift on strong earnings as trade fight caps gains; sterling slumps","text":"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets lifted on Monday after strong corporate earnings helped Wall Street close higher, but a tariff dispute between the United States and China limited gains in equities while boosting the dollar and helping keep Treasury yields lower.

Maduro, whose approval ratings hover around 25 percent, with opponents blaming his policies for worsening an economic meltdown, has urged supporters to unite in the face of what he described as right-wing plots led by the Colombian government and exiles in the United States. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has scoffed at the accusations, saying he was fully focused on his granddaughter&rsquo;s baptism, while U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said Washington was not involved in the blasts.

Many in attendance were public sector employees, some of whom said they had been ordered to attend, according to Reuters witnesses. Keen supporters of late leader Hugo Chavez have increasingly soured on his far less charismatic successor.  Maduro, who made a televised speech shortly after the incident, had been due to speak from the Miraflores palace on Monday afternoon.

The president lashed out at James after the three-time NBA champion was interviewed by CNN&rsquo;s Don Lemon largely to tout a public school in Akron, Ohio that his foundation helped to open last week. During the interview James said sports was something that unites Americans but that Trump &ldquo;used sport to kind of divide us,&rdquo; drawing the retaliatory tweet from the president. The &ldquo;I Promise&rdquo; public school in Akron, which opened last week, will offer classes for &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; students in the third and fourth grades and add first and second grades the following year, the foundation website said. The school will be finished by 2022 with first through eighth grades. James also promised a free bicycle and helmets for students  and vowed to pay tuition to the University of Akron for I Promise graduates, among other things. &ldquo;Anyone that&rsquo;s done what LeBron James has done for the past decade to 15 years for our children to prepare them to flourish in life has to be an intelligent person,&rdquo; Akron Public Schools spokesman Mark Williamson said in a telephone interview on Monday. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a bright guy, end of story.&rdquo; The comment came after Trump on Friday had tweeted &ldquo;Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn&rsquo;t easy to do. I like Mike!&rdquo; The president&rsquo;s &ldquo;I like Mike!&rdquo; comment was an apparent reference to the perennial sports debate over whether six-time NBA champion Michael Jordan, or James, a four-time league most valuable player, was the NBA&rsquo;s all-time best player. Jordan, who rarely wades into the political fray, and other U.S. athletes rallied to James&rsquo; defense on Saturday, praising him for his work in his community. James, a persistent critic of Trump and prominent supporter of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, last month announced his decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers for a second time, this time to play for the Los Angeles Lakers.  In response to Lemon asking what James would say to the president if he were sitting right there, the NBA star said: &ldquo;I would never sit across from him. ... I&rsquo;d sit across from Barack though,&rdquo; referring to Trump&rsquo;s predecessor, Barack Obama. Trump has lambasted National Football League players who  knelt during playing of the national anthem as a form of protest against law enforcement&rsquo;s treatment of racial minorities. And he has disinvited championship teams whose members have been critical of him from traditional White House visits. U.S. first lady Melania Trump also appeared to take exception with her husband&rsquo;s attack on James. &ldquo;It looks like LeBron James is working to do good things on behalf of our next generation and just as she always has, the first lady encourages everyone to have an open dialogue about issues facing children today,&rdquo; a statement issued by Melania Trump&rsquo;s spokeswoman said.  The spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a question on whether the first lady planned to visit the I Promise school.  LeBron James Family Foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Williamson called James a great role model. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never let our children down. Not once. He&rsquo;s never let these kids down,&rdquo; he said.

Corporate buybacks in the second quarter by S&P 500 companies are at $135.2 billion based on filings so far from 71.8 percent of the S&P 500 companies, the analysis said. That is about 2 percent below what the total was for a comparable amount of companies in the first quarter, when companies set the quarterly record for total actual S&P 500 buybacks, at $189.1 billion, the report showed. &ldquo;We have a shot at breaking that record,&rdquo; S&P Dow Jones senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt said on Monday, noting that buybacks for the second quarter were running above his expectations. At the same time, Goldman Sachs said in a note that it raised its estimate for 2018 corporate repurchase authorizations to a record $1 trillion, which would mark a 46 percent increase over last year. Buyback authorizations so far this year are up to $754 billion, Goldman said. The jump in planned and actual buybacks is largely due to a tax overhaul approved by Congress late last year.  Under the new tax law, domestic corporate profits will be taxed at 21 percent, down from 35 percent previously, while most foreign profits will no longer be taxed. The new law also allows companies to write off immediately the full value of new capital investments. &ldquo;Part of the uplift is a direct result of tax reform, but strong cash flow growth has also been essential,&rdquo; Goldman strategists wrote, adding that August was the most popular month for repurchase executions.

Angelo Calcaterra, the former head of construction company Iecsa and Macri&rsquo;s cousin, told prosecutors he was told by officials in former President Cristina Fernandez&rsquo; administration to pay cash in exchange for public works contracts, said the source on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing probe. &ldquo;The pressure was strong,&rdquo; the person said. Calcaterra could not be reached for comment. Calcaterra is the latest executive to speak with prosecutors in the case since last Wednesday, when newspaper La Nacion published contents of notebooks kept by a driver in the former administration that detail how he transported bribe money from construction companies to government officials from 2005-2015.

Cabot wrote that he made copies of the notebooks and then gave them to prosecutors in April. La Nacion decided not to publish the story until law enforcement acted on the information, he added. Prosecutor Carlos Stornelli is probing what he calls the &ldquo;criminal conspiracy to illegally raise money&rdquo; outlined in the notebooks. &ldquo;They hold an abundance of data and provide a kind of x-ray of the system,&rdquo; Stornelli told local radio. Stornelli&rsquo;s office declined to comment.  More than a dozen former government officials and business executives have been arrested since Wednesday, according to local media reports.

Berlin tightened controls on foreign investments last year after a series of high-profile takeovers by Chinese companies, making it possible for the government to intervene if a buyer amassed a shareholding of 25 percent. The Economy Ministry should be able to intervene if a non-EU investor &ldquo;acquires a direct or indirect shareholding of at least 15 percent of voting rights in a German company,&rdquo; Die Welt newspaper cited a draft law as saying. In Germany and other countries including the United States, France, Australia and Britain, there are concerns that China and other rivals are gaining access to key technologies via takeovers. The proposal to change the German Foreign Trade Ordinance is being coordinated with other ministries and a law that provides for more control could come into effect this year, Die Welt reported. &ldquo;When it comes to defense-related companies, critical infrastructure or certain areas of other civil security-related technologies such as IT security, we want to take a closer look in future,&rdquo; it quoted German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier as saying. &ldquo;Until now we&rsquo;ve only been able to make checks when at least 25 percent of a company&rsquo;s shares have been acquired. Now we want to lower this threshold so we can review more acquisitions in sensitive economic sectors,&rdquo; he added. Altmaier said Germany still wanted companies to invest in Germany but added attentiveness where such investment affects national security interests was part of the social market economy. Last week the German government signaled it was prepared to use a new power to veto foreign takeovers of German companies in the case of a Chinese bid for toolmaker Leifeld. That came after Leifeld&rsquo;s majority owner Georg Koffler said China&rsquo;s Yantai Taihai had dropped its attempt to buy the company ahead of an expected veto by the German government. Last month, a German state bank bought a stake in high-voltage grid operator 50Hertz to prevent China&rsquo;s state grid acquiring the shareholding and promised to consider ways of better protecting companies from foreign acquisition. The head of Germany&rsquo;s domestic intelligence service has also said that Chinese state actors seeking trade secrets could be behind bids that nominally came from private firms, highlighting a seeming correlation between a decline in hacking attempts originating from China with an increase in bids.

Corporate buybacks in the second quarter by S&P 500 companies are at $135.2 billion based on filings so far from 71.8 percent of the S&P 500 companies, the analysis said. That is about 2 percent below what the total was for a comparable amount of companies in the first quarter, when companies set the quarterly record for total actual S&P 500 buybacks, at $189.1 billion, the report showed. &ldquo;We have a shot at breaking that record,&rdquo; S&P Dow Jones senior index analyst Howard Silverblatt said on Monday, noting that buybacks for the second quarter were running above his expectations. At the same time, Goldman Sachs said in a note that it raised its estimate for 2018 corporate repurchase authorizations to a record $1 trillion, which would mark a 46 percent increase over last year. Buyback authorizations so far this year are up to $754 billion, Goldman said. The jump in planned and actual buybacks is largely due to a tax overhaul approved by Congress late last year.  Under the new tax law, domestic corporate profits will be taxed at 21 percent, down from 35 percent previously, while most foreign profits will no longer be taxed. The new law also allows companies to write off immediately the full value of new capital investments. &ldquo;Part of the uplift is a direct result of tax reform, but strong cash flow growth has also been essential,&rdquo; Goldman strategists wrote, adding that August was the most popular month for repurchase executions.

Speaking on a conference call after the San Diego-based firm released its second-quarter earnings, Martin said three of Sempra&rsquo;s directors visited Elliott&rsquo;s offices in New York to meet with the hedge fund and Bluescape Resources Co, a private investment fund founded by former utility executive John Wilder. In response to an analyst&rsquo;s question about how the talks with Elliott were going, Martin said he was &ldquo;actually quite optimistic with the tone of the conversations ... All the right people are engaged and I remain very optimistic about it.&rdquo; A source close to the talks said the discussions about a potential settlement were moving slower than Elliott wanted, however. Elliott declined to comment. Utilities based in California are already under pressure from the impact of devastating wildfires that have hit the state in the last two summers, with talk of possible legislation that could impose significant liabilities on them for damage caused by the blazes. Fellow utility PG&E Corp (PCG.N ) has hired restructuring advisers and is considering putting one of its units in bankruptcy, Reuters reported. Sempra has insisted since Elliott and Bluescape revealed their position in the company that while it was open to engagement, it believed its current strategy was best for creating long-term shareholder value and it remained focused on executing it. Martin repeated that sentiment on Monday. Elliott and Bluescape, which have joined forces to influence other U.S. utilities in the last two years, disclosed a position in Sempra on June 11 and called for new directors and for the company to pursue a strategic review.  In a 50-page presentation, the investors called for selling international business lines and to split its existing business into two companies through a tax-free spinoff - one focused on utilities and the other on natural gas infrastructure.

The Mendocino Complex Fire, made up of two separate conflagrations that merged at the southern tip of the Mendocino National Forest, had burned 273,664 acres (110,748 hectares) as of Monday and was still growing, on track to potentially become the largest in state history. &ldquo;Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re not going to get a break anytime soon,&rdquo; National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley said of firefighters who had cut buffer lines around 30 percent of the blaze. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty doggone hot and dry, and it&rsquo;s going to stay that way.&rdquo; Hurley said temperatures could reach 110 degrees (43 Celsius) in Northern California over the next few days with gusty winds fanning the flames.  The Mendocino Complex, which has destroyed 75 homes and forced thousands to flee, is the largest of eight major wildfires burning out of control across California, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to declare a &ldquo;major disaster&rdquo; in the state.  &ldquo;California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren&rsquo;t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized,&rdquo; Trump wrote on Twitter. A California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman declined to comment on Trump&rsquo;s tweet but said crews did not lack water to fight the flames. Environmental activists and some politicians say the  intensity of the state&rsquo;s wildfire season could be linked in part to climate change. A total of nearly 3,000 people were fighting the Mendocino Complex Fire, including crews from Arizona, Washington and Alaska.  Some 200 soldiers from the 14th Brigade Engineer Battalion at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, have also been called in to help in one of the most destructive fire seasons on record. On Sunday, 140 fire managers and specialists from Australia and New Zealand underwent special training and were issued  safety gear at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise before being deployed to fires in the Pacific Northwest and California. Crews battling the Mendocino Complex on Monday were focusing  on keeping flames from breaking through fire lines on a ridge  above the foothill communities of Nice, Lucerne, Glen Haven, and Clearlake Oaks, said Tricia Austin, a spokeswoman for Cal Fire.  &ldquo;If it were to be carried outside of those lines they have on the ridge, it could sweep down into those communities, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to prevent,&rdquo; she said. Elsewhere in California, evacuations were ordered for cabins in Cleveland National Forest canyons in Orange County on Monday afternoon after a blaze broke out and quickly spread to blacken some 700 acres (283 hectares). The Carr Fire - which has torched 163,207 acres (66,047.5 hectares) in the scenic Shasta-Trinity region north of Sacramento since breaking out on July 23 - was 45 percent contained. The Carr Fire has been blamed for seven deaths, including a 21-year-old apprentice PG&E lineman Jay Ayeta, whom the company said on Sunday was killed in a vehicle crash as he worked with crews in dangerous terrain.

The policy replaced an outright ban on transgender service members that Trump announced last year on Twitter, citing concern over military focus and medical costs.  U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington denied a request by the administration to lift an injunction she had issued against Trump&rsquo;s original ban.

(Reuters) - Rick Gates, a longtime business associate of U.S. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, on Monday testified that he helped Manafort file false tax returns and hide his foreign bank accounts. Gates is the government&rsquo;s star witness in its case against Manafort, who is accused of bank and tax fraud. Gates, who also served on Trump&rsquo;s campaign, pleaded guilty in February and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors under a deal that could lead to a reduced sentence. Taking the stand on the trial&rsquo;s fifth day, Gates admitted to helping Manafort doctor financial statements, hide foreign income and cheat on his taxes. He said he was aware Manafort was acting as an unregistered foreign agent in lobbying for Ukraine. He said he engaged in the wrongdoing at Manafort&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;At Mr. Manafort&rsquo;s request we did not disclose foreign bank accounts,&rdquo; Gates told the jury in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.  Manafort&rsquo;s defense hinges on pinning the blame on Gates, who they accuse of embezzling millions of dollars from Manafort.  Gates, who first met Manafort working for him as an intern fresh out of college, has been described by witnesses as Manafort&rsquo;s right-hand man in his multimillion-dollar political consulting business. Throughout his testimony, Gates largely avoided making eye contact with Manafort, who appeared to be watching him.  In addition to assisting in Manafort&rsquo;s alleged crimes, Gates told the jury he had failed to report income he routed through his bank accounts in the United Kingdom and said he stole several hundreds of thousands of dollars from Manafort by filing false and inflated expense reports. Those admissions are likely to become a focal point for Manafort&rsquo;s defense team when he is cross examined on Tuesday. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. The charges largely predate his five months on the Trump campaign. His case is the first to go to trial arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The jury has heard how Manafort made tens of millions of dollars for work with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Mueller is also investigating possible coordination between Trump campaign members and Russian officials in the election campaign, but the charges against Manafort do not address that. CYPRUS ACCOUNTS Gates also testified about how wealthy Ukrainian businessmen paid Manafort millions of dollars for his political services through wire transfers to Cyprus-based accounts that were set up for Manafort by a lawyer and local politician known as &ldquo;Dr. K.&rdquo; &ldquo;He indicated that the Ukrainian businessmen...had directed him to set up Cyprus accounts because the payments would be coming from Cyprus,&rdquo; Gates said when asked to explain the payment structure. Gates also testified that both he and Manafort had control over the foreign accounts, as well as Manafort&rsquo;s business associate Konstantin Kilimnik. Kilimnik is a Russian-Ukrainian political consultant who was indicted in June on charges stemming from the Mueller probe. In court filings, Mueller has accused Kilimnik of having ties to Russian intelligence services, an allegation he has denied. Gates testified that Manafort told him to report overseas income as loans to lower Manafort&rsquo;s taxable income, supporting the testimony of his accountant.  &ldquo;When income came into the company, Mr. Manafort directed whether it would be treated as income ...or loans,&rdquo; Gates said. The jury heard testimony on Friday and Monday from accountant Cynthia Laporta, who described how Manafort and Gates doctored financial statements and backdated loans.  Gates admitted in testimony on Friday that he had lied to Laporta, as well as other accountants and Manafort&rsquo;s bookkeeper. In questioning Laporta on Monday, a prosecutor asked her about a $10 million loan purportedly received by Manafort from Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska in 2006. Laporta said she had no indication that the loan from Deripaska had been paid off. Since the trial started before U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis last Tuesday, Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers have kept their cross-examinations brief and at times refrained from attempting to rebut damaging testimony in detail. But Laporta&rsquo;s testimony raised the stakes for Manafort. Testifying under immunity, she was the first witness to admit she knew accounting maneuvers Manafort and Gates requested of her were wrong and could be crimes. One accounting trick saved Manafort $500,000 in taxes, she said. Under cross examination on Monday, defense attorney Kevin Downing attempted to show that Gates was the point person in dealing with the accountants. But while Laporta acknowledged that she regularly communicated with Gates, she said she believed Manafort was in the know. &ldquo;In most instances it was clear Mr. Manafort knew what was going on,&rdquo; Laporta said. Slideshow (4 Images)  On redirect, prosecutor Uzo Asonye used a spreadsheet to show that Manafort&rsquo;s firm had earned $31 million in gross receipts between 2010 and 2014 - half the amount prosecutors say he netted during the same time frame in Ukraine.

The pound fell as low as $1.2917 before retracing to $1.2940, down 0.50 percent on the day.

Despite being jailed in April on a corruption conviction and sentenced to 12 years in prison, Lula was nominated by his Workers Party on Saturday to press its point that his conviction was political persecution aimed at stopping Brazil&rsquo;s most influential politician from returning to power. The country&rsquo;s top electoral court is expected to invalidate his candidacy when it is registered on the Aug. 15 deadline and the party has picked former Sao Paulo mayor Fernando Haddad as running mate to stand in for Lula if needed. Haddad said on Monday Lula had asked for the release petition to be dropped because of the risk that the top court would decide simultaneously that he was ineligible to run for office under an anti-corruption law. If the top court ruled, the electoral court would not be able to consider his case. By registering his candidacy at the last minute next week, the former leftist leader aims to keep Brazilian&rsquo;s attention on his case as long as possible, helping to transfer his popular support into votes for his party. &ldquo;It was a request for his release, but it appears that the petition was going to be used to rule on his eligibility in the election,&rdquo; Haddad told reporters after visiting Lula in his prison in the southern city of Curitiba. &ldquo;Lula has always said he will not trade his dignity for freedom,&rdquo; said Haddad, who is a lawyer and was added to the former president&rsquo;s defense team so that he could visit Lula regularly in jail. Lula governed Brazil for two terms from 2003-2010 and left office with a record approval rating of 87 percent thanks to a booming economy and social programs that lifted millions of Brazilians from poverty.  His popularity has been hurt by corruption indictments and scandals involving his party, which was ousted from power in 2016 when his hand-picked successor was impeached for breaking budget rules. Still, polls show about one third of Brazilians would vote for him if he is allowed to run \u2014 almost double his nearest adversary, far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro \u2014 and many of his supporters will vote for whomever replaces him in the race.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were down 8 cents at $68.93 barrel. U.S. sanctions against major oil exporter Iran are set to kick in at 12:01 a.m. U.S. Eastcoast time (0401 GMT) on Tuesday.

Household income also marked the fastest gain in three years on gains in temporary workers&rsquo; pay, offering some hope for Bank of Japan policymakers struggling to accelerate inflation to their elusive 2 percent target. The figures come ahead of Friday&rsquo;s release of second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data, which will likely show the economy expanded an annualized 1.4 percent after contracting in the previous quarter. Household spending fell 1.2 percent in June from a year earlier, government data showed on Tuesday, marking the fifth straight month of declines. But the fall was smaller than market forecasts of a 1.6 percent slide and a 3.9 percent drop in May. &ldquo;Household spending continued to fall but we&rsquo;re seeing some positive signs,&rdquo; said a government official who briefed reporters on the data, adding that spending may turn up in July as households spend their bonuses handed out at the end of June. Households&rsquo; inflation-adjusted income rose 4.4 percent in June, the biggest increase since July 2015, as a tightening job market pushed up temporary workers&rsquo; pay, the data showed. Separate data showed workers&rsquo; real wages rose 2.8 percent in June from a year earlier, accelerating from a 1.3 percent increase in May and marking the fastest pace of growth since January 1997. Private consumption has been a soft spot in the economy as slow wage growth prevents households from loosening their purse strings, in turn discouraging companies from hiking prices and keeping inflation far from the BOJ&rsquo;s 2 percent target. Signs of rising wages would be encouraging for the BOJ, which trimmed its inflation forecasts last week and blamed Japan&rsquo;s entrenched deflationary mindset for keeping price growth subdued.

The central bank, which is due to meet on Aug. 9, raised its benchmark interest rate PHCBIR=ECI by 25 basis points each in May and June, to tame inflation and shore up the peso, which has been battered by concerns over a widening current account deficit and capital outflows.  &ldquo;The BSP (central bank) still has to continue raising rates to assure consumers and the market that inflation is well anchored,&rdquo; Bank of the Philippine Islands economist Emilio Neri told news channel ANC. The peso has lost 5.7 percent against the dollar this year, making it one of Asia&rsquo;s worst performing currencies.

Officials from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) and the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, stressed that wild-land blazes are battled primarily by crews hacking away at dry brush with hand tools and bulldozers, not with water. &ldquo;Yes, we have plenty of water,&rdquo; CalFire Chief Scott McLean  said by telephone, adding that the two largest blazes in California this week - the Carr Fire and the Mendocino Complex Fire - were each ringed by at least three major reservoirs. He said the tweets, after Trump on Sunday approved a federal disaster declaration requested by Governor Jerry Brown for the fires, sparked a barrage of media queries to CalFire. On Sunday, Trump tweeted, &ldquo;California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren&rsquo;t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!&rdquo; Then on Monday he tweeted, &ldquo;Governor Jerry Brown must allow the Free Flow of the vast amounts of water coming from the North and foolishly being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Can be used for fires, farming and everything else. Think of California with plenty of Water - Nice! Fast Federal govt. approvals.&rdquo; The White House did not respond to requests to clarify Trump&rsquo;s tweets, and did not immediately respond when asked about Gleick&rsquo;s comments.  Firefighters on a structure protection team watch a plume of smoke grow from the Ranch Fire (Mendocino Complex) in the hills north of Upper Lake, August 1, 2018. REUTERS\/Fred Greaves Neither McLean nor Jessica Gardetto, a spokeswoman for the Idaho-based fire agency, would address the tweets directly, but Gardetto said by telephone, &ldquo;Most wildfire suppression efforts involve firefighters and boots on the ground.&rdquo;  Water, used in protecting homes and other structures and for dumping on flames from airplane tankers and helicopters, is critical but secondary to the larger manual efforts of clearing unburned vegetation to remove it as potential fuel around a fire&rsquo;s perimeter. Peter Gleick, one of California&rsquo;s leading experts on Western water resources as president of the Oakland-based Pacific Institute, said that Trump appeared to be seizing on the wildfires to side with farmers on a separate debate over how to allocate California&rsquo;s finite water resources among farmers, cities, fish and wildlife. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing that California water policy has done that makes these fires worse or more difficult to fight,&rdquo; Gleick said. Trump&rsquo;s references to diverting water to the oceans was &ldquo;completely backwards,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The water that reaches the ocean is what&rsquo;s left after we&rsquo;ve diverted most of the water away for cities and farms, and what little is left is barely enough for California&rsquo;s aquatic ecosystems and the fisheries,&rdquo; he said. The White House did not respond to requests to clarify Trump&rsquo;s tweets, and did not immediately respond when asked about Gleick&rsquo;s comments.  Trump&rsquo;s suggestion that environmental laws were somehow compounding wildfire woes drew derision on Twitter.

"},"27a4648cda23bc376dbe5d9ba7a20903":{"title":"Trump tweets on California wildfires spark confusion, debate","text":"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Fire authorities insisted on Monday that they have ample water supplies to fight California&rsquo;s devastating wildfires, contrary to U.S. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s tweets that unspecified water diversions to the Pacific were making matters worse. Officials from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) and the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho, stressed that wild-land blazes are battled primarily by crews hacking away at dry brush with hand tools and bulldozers, not with water. &ldquo;Yes, we have plenty of water,&rdquo; CalFire Chief Scott McLean  said by telephone, adding that the two largest blazes in California this week - the Carr Fire and the Mendocino Complex Fire - were each ringed by at least three major reservoirs. He said the tweets, after Trump on Sunday approved a federal disaster declaration requested by Governor Jerry Brown for the fires, sparked a barrage of media queries to CalFire. On Sunday, Trump tweeted, &ldquo;California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren&rsquo;t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!&rdquo; Then on Monday he tweeted, &ldquo;Governor Jerry Brown must allow the Free Flow of the vast amounts of water coming from the North and foolishly being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Can be used for fires, farming and everything else. Think of California with plenty of Water - Nice! Fast Federal govt. approvals.&rdquo; The White House did not respond to requests to clarify Trump&rsquo;s tweets.

REUTERS\/Fred Greaves Neither McLean nor Jessica Gardetto, a spokeswoman for the Idaho-based fire agency, would address the tweets directly, but Gardetto said by telephone, &ldquo;Most wildfire suppression efforts involve firefighters and boots on the ground.&rdquo;  Water, used in protecting homes and other structures and for dumping on flames from airplane tankers and helicopters, is critical but secondary to the larger manual efforts of clearing unburned vegetation to remove it as potential fuel around a fire&rsquo;s perimeter. Peter Gleick, one of California&rsquo;s leading experts on Western water resources as president of the Oakland-based Pacific Institute, said that Trump appeared to be seizing on the wildfires to side with farmers on a separate debate over how to allocate California&rsquo;s finite water resources among farmers, cities, fish and wildlife. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing that California water policy has done that makes these fires worse or more difficult to fight,&rdquo; Gleick said. Trump&rsquo;s references to diverting water to the oceans was &ldquo;completely backwards,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The water that reaches the ocean is what&rsquo;s left after we&rsquo;ve diverted most of the water away for cities and farms, and what little is left is barely enough for California&rsquo;s aquatic ecosystems and the fisheries,&rdquo; he said. The White House did not immediately respond when asked about Gleick&rsquo;s comments.  Trump&rsquo;s suggestion that environmental laws were somehow compounding wildfire woes drew derision on Twitter. Critics said his tweets ignored the greater wildfire frequency and severity experienced in California and other Western states from extreme drought and sustained periods of hot, dry weather, in keeping with the forecasts of climate scientists.

Chinese police have launched an investigation into Changsheng Biotechnology Co, its chairwoman and four senior executives over suspected criminal behavior, the official Xinhua news agency said late on Monday. Changsheng has been found to have falsified production documents related to a rabies vaccine and manufactured an ineffective vaccine for Chinese babies as young as three months, underscoring the challenge the world&rsquo;s second-biggest drug market faces cleaning up its image as it aims to promote its vaccines globally. According to the China Food and Drug Administration, Changsheng fabricated production records as well as product inspection records, and arbitrarily changed process parameters and equipment, in &ldquo;serious violations&rdquo; of the law. Shares in Chinese vaccine makers and biotech firms fell across the board on Monday after the country&rsquo;s Premier Li Keqiang had slammed the vaccine maker for having crossed a moral red line and called for swift action. While there have been no known reports of people being harmed by the vaccine, the regulator ordered Changsheng to halt production and recall the product after the scandal emerged earlier this month. The case has gone viral in China, where sensitivity over food and drug safety is extremely high after a slew of scandals over the last decade. It was among the most hotly discussed topics on microblogging website Sina Weibo on Monday. A hashtag related to the case had been read more than 600 million times by mid-afternoon on Monday, despite reports that some posts were being taken down by censors. &ldquo;All my friends are freaking out with this vaccine case, everyone is scared. It really reflects big loopholes and issues with China&rsquo;s food and drug safety regulation,&rdquo; wrote one Weibo user under the handle 1988 Cheng Hongyu. &ldquo;Yesterday it was milk powder, today vaccines. What will it be tomorrow?&rdquo; another wrote, referring to a major scandal in 2008 when several infants died after industrial chemical melamine was added to milk powder to raise protein levels. LI CALLS FOR PROBE Chinese President Xi Jinping, quoted on state television on Friday evening, said Changsheng&rsquo;s actions were &ldquo;shocking&rdquo; and that authorities should deal with the matter swiftly and look to improve the country&rsquo;s vaccine management system. Premier Li had earlier called for an immediate investigation into the company and urged severe punishment for those implicated. He added the public needed clear information. &ldquo;We will resolutely crack down on illegal and criminal acts that endanger the safety of peoples&rsquo; lives, resolutely punish lawbreakers according to the law, and resolutely and severely criticize dereliction of duty in supervision,&rdquo; he said. Changsheng apologized in a regulatory filing on Monday and said the suspension of its vaccine would hit its finances. It added some regional disease control agencies had suspended some of its other vaccines. The company said it also faces the risk of being delisted due to an investigation by China&rsquo;s securities regulator into suspected violations of information disclosure. Changsheng shares, which resumed trading on Monday afternoon session after being suspended in the morning, were down 10 percent. They have slumped 47 percent since mid-July. The wider CSI 300 healthcare index was down about 5 percent. PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS The Changsheng case is the latest in a slew of scandals that has plagued China&rsquo;s pharmaceutical industry in recent years. A regulator in the northeastern province of Jilin, where Changsheng is based, revealed on Friday that the company had last year sold 252,600 substandard DPT vaccines to inoculate children against diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus. Another company Wuhan Institute of Biological Products was also implicated in the DPT vaccine issue. Earlier, in 2016, Chinese police busted a gang for selling around $90 million worth of illegal vaccines on the black market. Last week European regulators found that a common blood pressure and heart drug manufactured in bulk by Chinese firm Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical may have contained an impurity linked to cancer since 2012. Marina Cui - a 25-year-old mother from the southwestern Yunnan province whose five-month-old child took a DPT vaccine last week - said the latest revelations had made her worried about the overall safety of vaccines. &ldquo;The recent fake vaccine scandal has really made me very scared,&rdquo; she said, adding she wanted clear information from authorities, rather than people with little knowledge or expertise stirring up parents&rsquo; emotional concerns. The country&rsquo;s official newspaper China Daily has cautioned the Changsheng case could become a public health crisis if not handled &ldquo;in a reasonable and transparent manner&rdquo;. The government needs to let the public know it &ldquo;will punish any wrongdoers without mercy&rdquo;, the paper wrote in an editorial. Late on Sunday, state news agency Xinhua ran an editorial calling for strict punishment for any violations and for regulators to tighten oversight of the industry. Slideshow (2 Images)  The state-run Global Times also weighed in, saying the case had &ldquo;sparked nationwide outrage, (and) could pose serious challenges for a domestic industry that has seen rapid growth in recent years but experienced a series of scandals&rdquo;.

It is the latest in a series of high-tech initiatives in the city-state, some of which have stoked privacy concerns among rights advocates, aimed at improving efficiency and security as the threat of militancy in the region has ratcheted up. Iris-scanning technology, which has been used in other countries like the United States and the United Kingdom with varying degrees of success, can cost five times more than existing fingerprint systems, according to experts. &ldquo;The trials will help us in our consideration of whether and how we should implement such technology at our checkpoints,&rdquo; the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said in an emailed statement. The move will be implemented at two checkpoints on its northern border with Malaysia and one at a ferry terminal running services to nearby Indonesian islands. The ICA has been collecting iris images from Singaporean citizens and permanent residents when they apply for identity cards or a passport since January last year. Singapore&rsquo;s Changi Airport is considering using facial recognition systems to find late passengers and the country also plans to use facial recognition capabilities in a project to fit cameras and sensors on over 100,000 lampposts.

Household income also marked the fastest gain in three years on an increase in temporary workers&rsquo; pay, offering some hope for Bank of Japan policymakers struggling to accelerate inflation to their elusive 2 percent target. The figures come ahead of Friday&rsquo;s release of second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data, which will likely show the economy expanded an annualized 1.4 percent after contracting in the previous quarter. &ldquo;Consumption has emerged from a soft patch in the first quarter and will underpin economic growth,&rdquo; said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. &ldquo;Export growth is stagnating, so we may not see external demand drive the economy. But that will be offset by strong capital expenditure and improvements in consumption.&rdquo; Household spending fell 1.2 percent in June from a year earlier, government data showed on Tuesday, marking the fifth straight month of declines. But the fall was smaller than market forecasts of a 1.6 percent slide and a 3.9 percent drop in May. While spending on housing renovations fell, consumers spent more on beverages, air conditioners and eat-outs due partly to hot weather during the month, the data showed. &ldquo;Household spending continued to fall but we&rsquo;re seeing some positive signs,&rdquo; said a government official who briefed reporters on the data, adding that spending may turn up in July as households spend their bonuses handed out at the end of June. Households&rsquo; inflation-adjusted income rose 4.4 percent in June, the biggest increase since July 2015, as a tightening job market pushed up temporary workers&rsquo; pay, the data showed. Separate data showed workers&rsquo; real wages rose 2.8 percent in June from a year earlier, accelerating from a 1.3 percent increase in May and marking the fastest pace of growth since January 1997. Signs of rising wages would be encouraging for the BOJ, which trimmed its inflation forecasts last week and blamed Japan&rsquo;s entrenched deflationary mindset for keeping price growth subdued. Private consumption has been a soft spot in the economy as slow wage growth prevents households from loosening their purse strings, in turn discouraging companies from hiking prices and keeping inflation far from the BOJ&rsquo;s 2 percent target. Although companies may now be finally raising wages to address a tightening job market, their business prospects could be clouded by escalating protectionism and fears the United States may impose auto import tariffs that would devastate Japan&rsquo;s exports. Some analysts warn that growth may be peaking for Japan&rsquo;s economy, which had enjoyed the longest streak of expansion since the 1980s bubble economy before shrinking in January-March. Factory output fell 2.1 percent in June, marking the second straight month of decline. Toyota Motor Corp said higher U.S. auto tariffs would ramp up the cost of vehicles produced locally and those imported from Japan. Such risks could cast a cloud over the BOJ&rsquo;s assumption that continued economic expansion would push inflation to its target. Economists polled by Reuters expect core consumer prices to rise just 1.0 percent in the next fiscal year to March 2020, far below the BOJ&rsquo;s projection of 1.5 percent. &ldquo;As long as inflation is hovering around 1 percent, the BOJ will maintain its ultra-easy policy. It likely won&rsquo;t move toward an exit for much of next year,&rdquo; said Minami of Norinchukin.

Nugroho told a news briefing on Monday some areas there were cut off after bridges collapsed. Riduan, a 45-year old man whose house in Karangkauhan on Lombok was partially destroyed, said he had received no aid so far and had to buy food on his own. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t get anything,&rdquo; he said while trying to rescue documents from his house.      Quakes continue to rattle the island, including a 5.5 magnitude tremor at around 2 a.m. (1800 GMT Monday), Indonesia&rsquo;s meteorology and geophysics agency said (BMKG). A total of 230 aftershocks were recorded by Tuesday morning, BMKG data showed. Slideshow (4 Images)  Lombok had already been hit by a 6.4 quake on July 29 that killed 17 people and briefly stranded several hundred trekkers on the slopes of a volcano. Tourists were still leaving Lombok on Tuesday, some seen riding in military buses while others took ferries to Bali to the west of Lombok. Officials said more than 2,000 people had been evacuated from the three Gili islands off the northwest coast of Lombok, where fears of a tsunami had spread soon after the quake. Tourists and Gili residents alike were seeking to leave the islands, according to Indonesia&rsquo;s search and rescue agency. There was no official figure for how many tourists were on the islands, with numbers jumping from an original estimate of about 1,000. Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.

The Mendocino Complex Fire, made up of two separate conflagrations that merged, grew to 283,800 acres (114,800 hectares) and was still growing, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.  The fire surpassed the Thomas Fire, which burned 281,893 acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in 2017, as prime weather conditions are expected to persist.  &ldquo;Unfortunately, they&rsquo;re not going to get a break anytime soon,&rdquo; National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley said of firefighters who had cut buffer lines around 30 percent of the blaze. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty doggone hot and dry, and it&rsquo;s going to stay that way.&rdquo; Hurley said temperatures could reach 110 degrees (43 Celsius) in Northern California over the next few days with gusty winds fanning the flames.  The Mendocino Complex, which has destroyed 75 homes and forced thousands to flee, is the largest of eight major wildfires burning out of control across California, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to declare a &ldquo;major disaster&rdquo; in the state.  A total of nearly 3,900 people were fighting the Mendocino Complex Fire, including crews from Arizona, Washington and Alaska.  Some 200 soldiers from the 14th Brigade Engineer Battalion at Joint Base Lewis-McChord near Tacoma, Washington, have also been called in to help in one of the most destructive fire seasons on record. On Sunday, 140 fire managers and specialists from Australia and New Zealand underwent special training and were issued  safety gear at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise before being deployed to fires in the Pacific Northwest and California. Crews battling the Mendocino Complex on Monday were focusing  on keeping flames from breaking through fire lines on a ridge  above the foothill communities of Nice, Lucerne, Glen Haven, and Clearlake Oaks, said Tricia Austin, a spokeswoman for Cal Fire.  &ldquo;If it were to be carried outside of those lines they have on the ridge, it could sweep down into those communities, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re trying to prevent,&rdquo; she said. Elsewhere in California, evacuations were ordered for cabins in Cleveland National Forest canyons in Orange County on Monday afternoon after a blaze broke out and quickly spread to blacken some 700 acres (283 hectares). The Carr Fire - which has torched 163,207 acres (66,047.5 hectares) in the scenic Shasta-Trinity region north of Sacramento since breaking out on July 23 - was 45 percent contained. The Carr Fire has been blamed for seven deaths, including a 21-year-old apprentice PG&E lineman Jay Ayeta, whom the company said on Sunday was killed in a vehicle crash as he worked with crews in dangerous terrain.    &ldquo;California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren&rsquo;t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized,&rdquo; Trump wrote on Twitter. A California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman declined to comment on Trump&rsquo;s tweet but said crews did not lack water to fight the flames. Environmental activists and some politicians say the  intensity of the state&rsquo;s wildfire season could be linked in part to climate change.

The sale of its 40 percent stake in the Bengalla thermal coal mine to New Hope Corp at a big profit follows Wesfarmers&rsquo; sale of its Curragh mine last December, and a less glorious exit from a disastrous foray into British hardware.  Investors expect Wesfarmers will use the proceeds to pay down debt, positioning for its next acquisition. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d argue it&rsquo;s probably destined to be a domestic business only, after the UK failure. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see what they do next,&rdquo; said Jason Beddow, Managing Director of Argo Investments, Wesfarmers&rsquo; eighth-largest shareholder.  The conglomerate is now getting set to spin off its biggest business, Australia&rsquo;s no.2 supermarket chain Coles, estimated to be worth about A$16 billion. The Bengalla sale to New Hope came as no surprise, as the Australian miner, one of only a handful still expanding in thermal coal amid concerns over global warming, already owns 40 percent of the mine and had flagged it wanted more.  New Hope agreed to pay virtually the same price for the stake from Wesfarmers as it paid in 2016, even though coal prices are more than double what they were when it bought global miner Rio Tinto&rsquo;s stake in the mine. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fair price because these assets are priced on long term coal forecasts,&rdquo; New Hope Managing Director Shane Stephan told Reuters.  New Hope&rsquo;s shares jumped as much as 10 percent to their highest level in 4-1\/2 years in a weaker broader market. Wesfarmers shares inched up 0.5 percent. Bengalla, which is expected to continue producing for more than 20 years, made up more than half of New Hope&rsquo;s profit last year.  The company has no further acquisitions on the radar, focusing now on securing approvals to extend the life of its Acland mine in Queensland and a final investment decision on a small new mine, Stephan said. Debt-free New Hope expects to pay for the Bengalla stake from cash and a new bank credit facility. Wesfarmers, which reports annual results on Aug. 15, expects to book a pre-tax profit in the range of A$670 million to A$680 million on the sale. The other partners in Bengalla, Taiwan&rsquo;s Taipower and Japan&rsquo;s Mitsui , with 10 percent each, have pre-emptive rights to match New Hope&rsquo;s offer, but didn&rsquo;t exercise those rights when coal prices were much lower.

Spot Brent crude oil futures were at $73.88 per barrel at 0241 GMT on Tuesday, up 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 1 cent at $69.02 barrel.

Many countries, including U.S. allies in Europe as well as China and India oppose the introduction of new sanctions, but the U.S. government said it wants as many countries as possible to stop buying Iranian oil. &ldquo;It is our policy to get as many countries to zero as quickly as possible. We are going to work with individual countries on a case-by-case basis, but our goal is to reduce the amount of revenue and hard currency going into Iran,&rdquo; said a senior U.S. administration official on Monday. French bank Societe Generale said that while there was currently &ldquo;comfortable supply in the physical crude markets... Iran sanctions will take another 1 million bpd off the markets&rdquo;, warning that this would leave markets with little spare capacity to deal with unforseen disruptions.

Some analysts warned that a global heat wave could also now affect oil demand. Much of the northern hemisphere has been gripped by extreme heat this summer, pushing up demand for industrial and residential cooling.  This mostly impacts demand for power fuels such as thermal coal and natural gas. But U.S. bank JPMorgan said a warmer-than-usual fourth quarter, caused by a potential El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, &ldquo;can cause droughts, flooding and other natural disasters across the globe, including heatwaves in the U.S. that affect commodities&rdquo;. &ldquo;Past instances of El Ni\u00f1o have resulted in sharp drops in U.S. residential and commercial heating oil demand and prices,&rdquo; it said.

While the proposal has been welcomed by the palm oil industry and government, it has raised concerns among the automobile industry the fuel could impact engine performance. Environmentalists fear the boost to local palm oil consumption will hasten Indonesia&rsquo;s already fast spreading deforestation. The following explains some of the issues surrounding the drive to increase biodiesel usage. For a graphic on Indonesian oil imports, click reut.rs\/2vfmzan CURRENT ACCOUNT Indonesia currently imports around 400,000 barrels per day of crude oil and a roughly similar amount of refined products, which makes Southeast Asia&rsquo;s largest economy vulnerable to the sort of increases in global crude prices seen over the past year. With the current account deficit estimated to grow by $8 billion in 2018, the plan is to cut diesel imports by mandating that all diesel consumers, including power plants and railways, use biodiesel that contains 20 percent bio-content (B20), typically palm oil. Officials estimate this will save Indonesia around $6 billion per year. For a related graphic, click reut.rs\/2LQFfHZ         The program will increase domestic consumption of palm oil in the world&rsquo;s largest producer of the edible oil, providing a market for output that has climbed by 35 percent over the past five years. FAME In Indonesia, the bio component in biodiesel consists of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) made from palm oil. Indonesia has 26 FAME producers, including units of palm oil giants like Sinar Mas Group, Wilmar (WLIL.SI ), and Musim Mas, according to the Indonesian Biofuels Producers Association (APROBI). FAME is supplied to fuel distributors including Pertamina, blended with petroleum-based diesel and sold to end-users. For a graphic on Indonesia's energy sector, click reut.rs\/2Mc915Y  Currently only around one-quarter of Indonesia&rsquo;s FAME production capacity is utilized, and the new program could raise this to up to 50 percent, said Togar Sitanggang, a senior official at the Indonesia Palm Oil Association (GAPKI).  The government has said it will provide incentives to biodiesel producers, but has not provided details. COMPATIBILITY Efforts to increase FAME concentrations in biodiesel have faced resistance from regulators and the automotive and oil industries in the past.  Indonesia is supporting a program to make 100-percent palm oil-based biodiesel without FAME. Rules introduced in 2015 make B20 mandatory in subsidized biodiesel up to January 2020, after which B30 is scheduled to become mandatory. While B20 use is generally accepted for new vehicles, higher FAME blends may pose problems. FAME has a solvent effect that can corrode engine seals and gaskets, potentially increasing maintenance costs, and requiring special handling and equipment. &ldquo;High-level biodiesel blends can also impact engine warranties, gel in cold temperatures, and may present unique storage issues,&rdquo; the U.S. Department of Energy&rsquo;s Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) said on its website. For a related graphic, click reut.rs\/2O5MHeM According to the AFDC, the more FAME there is above 20 percent in biodiesel, the lower its energy content. FAME use could also increase nitrogen oxide emissions, although it greatly reduces other toxic emissions, it said. In a 2016 assessment, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) concluded that biodiesel with no more than 20 percent FAME content was acceptable for vehicles that comply with the Euro IV emissions standard, among other conditions. 40,000 KM TEST In a 2015 study by Indonesia&rsquo;s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT), six passenger vehicles from three manufacturers were driven over 40,000 km (25,000 miles) using B20 biodiesel and regular diesel. The test found that B20 improved vehicle performance and acceleration, and reduced emissions, but the vehicles consumed roughly 4 percent more fuel than vehicles using regular diesel. Tatang Soerawidjaja, chairman of the Indonesian Association of Bioenergy Scientists and Technologists, said extensive tests have shown that B20 poses &ldquo;no problems&rdquo; for diesel engines, even in older models. Filters would only need replacement or more frequent cleaning in the early phase of adopting biodiesel use, he said, referring to FAME&rsquo;s solvent effect when mixed with regular diesel. &ldquo;The bio content cleans dirt off of the tank&rsquo;s walls and pipes, and this ends up in the filter,&rdquo; he said.

A court in the Congolese capital Brazzaville sentenced each of the soldiers in April for the killings of 11 civilians committed in 2014 while the soldiers were serving in an African Union peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic. HRW said it secured a copy of the written judgment only last month. The three men are now free, having already served most of their sentences, HRW said in a statement. Although the court found the soldiers guilty of war crimes which can carry the death penalty under Congolese law, its judgment cited unspecified extenuating circumstances. &ldquo;The authorities in the Republic of Congo missed an opportunity to provide justice for the murders of civilians and to show that no peacekeeper is above the law,&rdquo; said Lewis Mudge, a senior researcher at HRW.  &ldquo;Giving the soldiers who committed murder little more than a slap on the wrist sent a damaging message to other peacekeepers that they risk little if they commit such crimes.&rdquo; Congo&rsquo;s government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The government of President Denis Sassou Nguesso, one of Africa&rsquo;s most secretive with a history of repression at home, has previously rejected claims that it has ignored allegations of human rights abuses against its soldiers.  Failure to hold peacekeepers accountable for crimes committed on foreign soil is a recurring complaint of rights activists. The responsibility to prosecute falls on troop-contributing countries who are often unwilling or unable to press charges against their troops. According to HRW, the Congolese peacekeepers killed an unarmed boy and arrested at least 12 other civilians in the Central African town of Boali in March 2014 after a peacekeeper was killed in a firefight with a local militia leader.  The bodies of the 12 people were found nearby in a mass grave in February 2016. The remains of a 7-month-old baby who was also killed were never found, HRW said. The Congolese court judgment referred only to 11 of the victims. Congo Republic&rsquo;s hundreds of peacekeepers in Central African Republic later became part of a U.N. mission. They were repatriated last year following multiple allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation.

The world&rsquo;s largest operator of mobile telecommunications towers last week priced its shares at HK1.26 each, the bottom of its indicative range, to raise $6.9 billion. That took the amount raised by companies listing in Hong Kong in 2018 to $22.4 billion, in the city&rsquo;s best performance by this point in the year, showed data from Thomson Reuters. That makes it the world&rsquo;s leading center for capital raising, ahead of second-placed New York Stock Exchange at $20.6 billion. However, China Tower&rsquo;s IPO comes just weeks after other notable deals struggled upon debut. Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK ) suffered a weak debut in early July after raising $4.7 billion. The stock recovered to trade as much as 30 percent above its IPO price but has since slipped to just 1.2 percent higher at $17.22. Earlier this month, Ascletis Pharma Inc (1672.HK ) became the first firm to list under new rules for biotech startups, having raised $400 million. Its shares began trading on Wednesday but had fallen as much as 31 percent by Friday. On Monday, they were trading at HK$10.9, down 22 percent from their issue price. &ldquo;Stocks like Xiaomi which aimed for a higher valuation, and Ascletis, which is seen a lead for biotechs in testing valuation, both failed to impress and that will make it harder for upcoming IPOs to take any aggressive approach in pricing,&rdquo; said Steven Leung, a sales director at broker UOB Kay Hian. Nasdaq-listed Beigene Ltd (6160.HK ) will become the second biotech to list under the new rules when it floats on Wednesday after raising $903 million. Market participants said broader market weakness has not helped, with investors fretting over the potential impact of Sino-U.S. tit-for-tat import tariffs. The benchmark Hang Seng share price index has lost 3.5 percent since the start of July. &ldquo;Particularly strong risk appetite is required for IPOs in the current climate,&rdquo; said Alex Wong, a director of asset management at Ample Capital. This year, 159 firms have applied to list on the Hong Kong stock exchange&rsquo;s Main Board, putting 2018 on course to be the IPO market&rsquo;s busiest year in at least a decade, showed data from bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (0388.HK ).  However, no Hong Kong stock currently features in the year&rsquo;s top 20 first-day IPO gains worldwide. Of firms selling over $500 million worth of shares, payments processor Adyen NV (ADYEN.AS ) jumped 90 percent on its Amsterdam debut in June, showed data from Dealogic. Online flea market operator Mercari Inc (4385.T ) added 77 percent on its first day in Tokyo.

China currently has ten times more sites to support 5G communications than the United States. In just three months of 2017, Chinese cell phone tower companies and carriers added more sites than the U.S had done in the previous three years, the Deloitte Consulting report found. The first countries to adopt the next generation of wireless communications will experience &ldquo;disproportionate gains,&rdquo; as 5G brings an &ldquo;era of untapped economic potential&rdquo;, the report said.

The report notes it may also be about 35 percent cheaper to install equipment necessary to add carriers to 5G in China as compared to the United States.     This report comes after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission announced new rules for bidding on high-band spectrum which is expected to be used in the future for 5G.   Dan Littmann, a principal at Deloitte, said in a statement that &ldquo;for the U.S. to remain competitive and eventually emerge as a leader, the race to 5G should be carefully evaluated and swift actions should be taken.&rdquo; The United States could still catch up, the report said, and  recommended the U.S adjust policy to reduce deployment time, encourage carriers to collaborate, and implement a database of statistics and best practices.

The Alibaba units to be merged include food delivery platform Ele.me and food and lifestyle services firm Koubei, the people said. Alibaba is looking to raise between $3 billion and $5 billion for the combined entity, said one of the sources. The entity could be valued at up to $25 billion, said another. A Hong Kong-based Alibaba task force is working on the merger and fundraising for the combined entity, according to two of the people.     Alibaba&rsquo;s units and Meituan, backed by social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings (0700.HK ), are fighting for supremacy in China&rsquo;s buoyant online-to-offline (O2O) market where apps link smartphone users with bricks-and-mortar businesses to provide local food delivery and other offerings. Slideshow (2 Images)  &ldquo;Alibaba and Meituan are the two main companies that can offer comprehensive O2O services,&rdquo; said Mo Jia, a Shanghai-based research analyst with technology consultancy Canalys. &ldquo;Alibaba&rsquo;s three units are complementary to each other and it has strategic logic to merge them into one platform to compete with Meituan.&rdquo;   One of the people said the fundraising was expected to launch later this year. The person said the new unit would also include Alibaba&rsquo;s Hema Fresh, a chain of cashless supermarkets offering fresh produce and food delivery.  Alibaba, which also handles media queries for Koubei and Hema, declined to comment. A spokesman for Ele.me denied the merger and fundraising plan. All the people declined to be named as the information is confidential. The value of O2O transactions in China jumped 72 percent last year to $146 billion, according to Chinese research firm Analysys. According to a June report by Chinese research firm iiMedia Research, Ele.me and Baidu Waimai, which Ele.me acquired a year ago, held a combined 55 percent of China&rsquo;s food delivery market in the first quarter compared with Meituan&rsquo;s 41 percent. China&rsquo;s biggest ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing also entered the fray in April launching its own food delivery service.   Meituan Dianping is expected to raise more than $4 billion when it floats in Hong Kong in the coming months. Last year the company was valued at $30 billion in a fundraising round.

Mnangagwa has urged Zimbabweans to unite after he was declared the first elected head of state since Robert Mugabe&rsquo;s removal from power, but the opposition leader has insisted he won and has pledged to challenge the result. China has close economic and diplomatic ties with Zimbabwe, which it has been keen to maintain after Mugabe&rsquo;s ouster last November in a de facto coup that brought his former ally Mnangagwa to power. &ldquo;In a congratulatory message dated Sunday, Xi expressed his wishes that the Zimbabwean government and people would make more achievements in national development under Mnangagwa&rsquo;s leadership,&rdquo; Xinhua said. Xi expects to meet Mnangagwa next month when he visits Beijing for a summit of Chinese and African leaders, it added. &ldquo;Xi said he hoped the meeting with Mnangagwa in Beijing could push forward the comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation between the two countries.&rdquo; On Monday, Zimbabwe&rsquo;s main opposition said security forces were abducting its members in night raids to intimidate the party and stop it challenging Mnangagwa&rsquo;s win.

The Alibaba units to be merged include food delivery platform Ele.me and food and lifestyle services firm Koubei, the people said. Alibaba is looking to raise between $3 billion and $5 billion for the combined entity, said one of the sources. The entity could be valued at up to $25 billion, said another. A Hong Kong-based Alibaba task force is working on the merger and fundraising for the combined entity, according to two of the people.     Alibaba&rsquo;s units and Meituan, backed by social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings (0700.HK ), are fighting for supremacy in China&rsquo;s buoyant online-to-offline (O2O) market where apps link smartphone users with bricks-and-mortar businesses to provide local food delivery and other offerings. Slideshow (2 Images)  &ldquo;Alibaba and Meituan are the two main companies that can offer comprehensive O2O services,&rdquo; said Mo Jia, a Shanghai-based research analyst with technology consultancy Canalys. &ldquo;Alibaba&rsquo;s three units are complementary to each other and it has strategic logic to merge them into one platform to compete with Meituan.&rdquo;   One of the people said the fundraising was expected to launch later this year. The person said the new unit would also include Alibaba&rsquo;s Hema Fresh, a chain of cashless supermarkets offering fresh produce and food delivery.  Alibaba, which also handles media queries for Koubei and Hema, declined to comment. A spokesman for Ele.me denied the merger and fundraising plan. All the people declined to be named as the information is confidential. The value of O2O transactions in China jumped 72 percent last year to $146 billion, according to Chinese research firm Analysys. According to a June report by Chinese research firm iiMedia Research, Ele.me and Baidu Waimai, which Ele.me acquired a year ago, held a combined 55 percent of China&rsquo;s food delivery market in the first quarter compared with Meituan&rsquo;s 41 percent. China&rsquo;s biggest ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing also entered the fray in April launching its own food delivery service.   Meituan Dianping is expected to raise more than $4 billion when it floats in Hong Kong in the coming months. Last year the company was valued at $30 billion in a fundraising round.

The lone volcanic fissure that was still active last week has dwindled from a fountain of molten rock to a bubbling pond of lava no longer spilling out of the blackened cone surrounding it, said Tina Neal, chief scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey&rsquo;s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. Levels of sulfur dioxide gas vented from the fissure, located on the lower east flank of Kilauea, about 25 miles (40 km) from its summit crater, have also dropped dramatically, she said. FILE PHOTO: Lava fragments falling from lava fountains at fissure 8 are building a cinder-and-spatter cone around the erupting vent, with the bulk of the fragments falling on the downwind side of the cone as it continues to feed a channelized lava flow that reaches the ocean at Kapoho during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, U.S. June 11, 2018.    USGS\/Handout via REUTERS  The subdued activity there coincided with another major collapse in the outer wall of the summit crater last Thursday, followed by a final flurry of earthquakes before the peak of the volcano grew still. &ldquo;The system appears to have almost shut down completely over the course of a couple of days,&rdquo; Neal told reporters on a conference call. She said it was &ldquo;all consistent with something turning off the spigot to the surface.&rdquo; At this point, the volcanic reservoir at the bottom of the summit crater appeared &ldquo;significantly drained&rdquo; of magma - the term for molten rock before it erupts - that was feeding the lava vents downslope at the surface. At the height of Kilauea&rsquo;s current eruption, which began on May 3, a total of two dozen fissures had opened in the ground at the foot of the volcano, in an area scientists call the lower east rift zone. But only one vent, dubbed Fissure 8, was still active last week. FILE PHOTO: Lava erupts in Leilani Estates during ongoing eruptions of the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, U.S., June 5, 2018.  REUTERS\/Terray Sylvester  It was a river of lava from Fissure 8 that had crept eastward to the ocean, engulfing two seaside housing developments before pouring into the Pacific. Hundreds more dwellings have been swallowed closer to the eruption site. The property losses marked the most destructive eruption event of Kilauea or any other volcano in Hawaii&rsquo;s recorded history. Neal said it remains to be seen whether the reduced flow at Fissure 8 will turn out to be a brief pause or an extended lull, or whether other vents will reactivate. A similar 88-day eruption in the lower east rift zone in 1955 was punctuated by one pause of five days and one lasting 16 days, Neal said.  Neal said scientists would be surprised if the summit crater produced any new major eruptions in the near future. The current shift in volcanic activity happened as Hurricane Hector churned across the Pacific toward Hawaii, with forecasters predicting it would skirt past the southern coast of the Big Island on Wednesday. Neal said the storm would have no effect on the volcano, except for the possibility of large steam clouds producing &ldquo;white-out&rdquo; conditions in areas where heavy rain falls on top of molten lava that has yet to thoroughly cool.

He said rules on Indonesian food imports had already been revised.  The process of seeking compensation often take years, and Indonesia is likely to contest the size of any potential sanctions. There was no immediate sign of a similar sanctions request from New Zealand, which said last year Indonesia&rsquo;s restrictions were estimated to have cost New Zealand beef sector up to NZ$1 billion.

The latest U.S. filing said Indonesia had not complied with the ruling, so Washington was seeking annual sanctions to compensate for the damage done to U.S. interests.  &ldquo;Based on a preliminary analysis of available data for certain products, this level is provisionally estimated at up to approximately $350 million for 2017,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;The United States will update this figure annually, as Indonesia&rsquo;s economy continues to expand. Indonesia is still studying the U.S. move to seek sanctions, said Oke Nurwan, trade ministry&rsquo;s director general of foreign trade, adding that authorities believe Jakarta had complied with the WTO panel decision. He said rules on Indonesian food imports had already been revised.  The process of seeking compensation often take years, and Indonesia is likely to contest the size of any potential sanctions. There was no immediate sign of a similar sanctions request from New Zealand, which said last year Indonesia&rsquo;s restrictions were estimated to have cost New Zealand beef sector up to NZ$1 billion. ($673 million) Indonesia has been lobbying senior U.S. officials to keep the Southeast Asian nation on a list of countries that receive special trade terms under the Generalized System of Preferences, a facility that gives reduced tariffs to about $2 billion of Indonesian exports. The U.S. Trade Representative&rsquo;s Office in April said it was reviewing Indonesia&rsquo;s eligibility for GSP in light of Jakarta&rsquo;s imposition of a wide array of trade and investment barriers that create serious negative effects on U.S. commerce. Indonesia&rsquo;s trade minister Enggartiasto Lukita in July said he will advise Washington that Indonesia will remove trade barriers for U.S. apples following a WTO ruling as part of lobbying for GSP. Indonesia scrapped a quota system for beef imports in 2016.

Every minute, one person arrives to live in Australia, the data shows, underpinning demand for everything from homes to cars, schools and hospitals, and boosting the country&rsquo;s economic fortunes.  The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the country&rsquo;s population will reach 26 million in three years&rsquo; time, based on current trends. The rapid increase in migrant numbers has sparked a debate on the economic and social impact of migration given inadequate infrastructure has resulted in clogged cities while an expanding labor market has capped wage growth. &ldquo;Coping means continuing to invest in infrastructure,&rdquo; Treasurer Scott Morrison said on 3AW Radio on Tuesday, when asked if Australia can cope with 25 million people. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve got a A$75 billion infrastructure plan. There has to be to support that growth that we&rsquo;re seeing in our population.&rdquo; Australia&rsquo;s economic success is built on migration with more than a third of the population born overseas, according to the latest census data which shows England, China, New Zealand and India as the top countries where migrants come from.  A separate ABS study released in June shows net overseas migration now accounts for 62 percent of total population growth. Natural increase makes up 38 percent. But immigration has become a political hot potato as the ruling centre-right coalition government and the opposition Labor party start campaigning for the New South Wales state election due next March followed by national elections in May. Far right politician Pauline Hanson has blamed the rising migrant numbers for growing inequality in Australia, while Senator Dean Smith became the first member of the government earlier this year to call for a review into population growth. Smith has argued the rapid intake has put a huge strain on the infrastructure of the country&rsquo;s largest cities - Sydney and Melbourne - home to the vast majority of newcomers. &ldquo;The 25 million milestone is a perfect opportunity to engage in a broad public discussion about what future population growth should look like for Australia and how that can be balanced with preserving high living standards and quality of life,&rdquo; Smith told Reuters.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $69.21 barrel. U.S. sanctions against Iran, which shipped out almost 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July, officially came into effect at 12:01 a.m. U.S. Eastern time (0401 GMT) on Tuesday. &ldquo;The U.S. seems hell-bent on regime change in Iran,&rdquo; said Greg McKenna,\u00a0chief\u00a0market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

The Mendocino Complex grew to span 283,000 acres (114,526 hectares) on Monday when two wildfires merged at the southern tip of the Mendocino National Forest, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.  It is the largest of eight major fires burning out of control across California, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to declare a &ldquo;major disaster&rdquo; in the state.  The size of the fire has surpassed that of last year&rsquo;s Thomas Fire, which burned 281,893 acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties when it destroyed more than 1,000 structures.  The Mendocino Complex has burned 75 homes and forced thousands to be evacuated.  Temperatures could reach 110 degrees (43 Celsius) in Northern California over the next few days with gusty winds fanning the flames of the complex, a National Weather Service meteorologist said.    The 3,900 crews battling the Mendocino Complex on Monday were focusing on keeping flames from breaking through fire lines on a ridge above the foothill communities of Nice, Lucerne, Glen Haven, and Clearlake Oaks, said Tricia Austin, a spokeswoman for Cal Fire.  Elsewhere in California, evacuations were ordered for cabins in Cleveland National Forest canyons in Orange County on Monday afternoon after a blaze broke out and quickly spread to span 700 acres (283 hectares). The Carr Fire - which has torched 164,413 acres in the scenic Shasta-Trinity region north of Sacramento since breaking out on July 23 - was 47 percent contained. The Carr Fire has been blamed for seven deaths, including a 21-year-old Pacific Gas and Electric Company lineman Jay Ayeta, whom the company said on Sunday was killed in a vehicle crash as he worked with crews in dangerous terrain.    &ldquo;California wildfires are being magnified and made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren&rsquo;t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized,&rdquo; Trump wrote on Twitter. A California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman declined to comment on Trump&rsquo;s tweet but said crews did not lack water to fight the flames. Environmental activists and some politicians say the  intensity of the state&rsquo;s wildfire season could be linked in part to climate change.

While banking is very different to pharmaceuticals, Walmsley said Mackay would bring valuable experience as the finance head of another complex global organization within a highly regulated industry. &ldquo;He is a strong leader with a track record of driving cost, cash and capital allocation discipline to deliver strategy. These capabilities will be vital as we continue to implement our innovation, performance and trust priorities for the benefit of patients and shareholders,&rdquo; she added. He also has some experience in healthcare as a trustee of the British Heart Foundation. Before HSBC he was at General Electric, Schlumberger Dowell and Price Waterhouse. Mackay will be replaced at HSBC by Ewen Stevenson, currently chief financial officer of the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L ).

The woman, an identified by police as &ldquo;H&rdquo;, was rescued on Sunday in Tolitoli regency, in Central Sulawesi province.  Acting on a tip-off, police said they had found the woman, who was now aged 28, in a rocky crevice in a jungle near Bajugan village, where she had been held during the day since her disappearance in 2003. At night, police said she stayed in a hut near the house of the 83-year old man, identified by police as JG. Central Sulawesi Police Chief Muhammad Iqbal Alqudusy said the man had shown the girl a picture of a boy named Amrin &ldquo;who she thought was her boyfriend&rdquo;. &ldquo;She was led to believe that Amrin&rsquo;s spirit had entered (the elderly man&rsquo;s) body,&rdquo; Iqbal said on Tuesday at a news conference that was posted online. &ldquo;It is obvious that he was satisfying his lust.&rdquo; Indonesia is a predominantly Muslim country but old beliefs about spirits and other paranormal activity are still held by some. Iqbal later told Reuters the woman said she had been having intercourse with &ldquo;Jin Amrin&rdquo; since 2003 &ldquo;but she was really having sex with JG&rdquo;. The man, he said, admitted to sexual relations since 2008. Police said they found the woman after her sister alerted neighbours she was nearby. According to the Jakarta Post, the sister was married to the son of the shaman, known for his traditional healing methods and abilities to channel spirits. The man explained the victim&rsquo;s disappearance to her parents by saying she had gone to Indonesia&rsquo;s capital, Jakarta, to work, the newspaper reported.     The man has been charged with offences under Indonesia&rsquo;s child protection laws, which carry a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.

India has in recent months intensified efforts to crack down on mass message forwards after it found that people were using social media and messaging apps to spread rumors and stoke public anger. WhatsApp in particular has faced the wrath of Indian regulators after false messages circulated on the messaging platform led to a series of lynchings and mob beatings across the country. The department of telecommunications in July asked Indian telecom service providers, as well as mobile and internet industry bodies, to &ldquo;explore various possible options&rdquo; to block such apps. &ldquo;You are ... requested to explore various possible options and confirm how the Instagram\/Facebook\/Whatsapp\/Telegram and such other mobile apps can be blocked on internet,&rdquo; according to the government letter dated July 18 and seen by Reuters. FILE PHOTO: The WhatsApp messaging application is seen on a phone screen August 3, 2017.   REUTERS\/Thomas White\/File Photo  Facebook Inc, which owns both WhatsApp and photo-sharing platform Instagram, declined to comment. Telegram did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A source at India&rsquo;s department of telecommunication said the letter was aimed at finding ways to block such apps during &ldquo;emergency situations&rdquo;.  &ldquo;There is a need for a reasonable good solution to protect national security,&rdquo; said the official, who declined to be named. For WhatsApp, India is its biggest market with more than 200 million users and one where it says people forward more messages, photographs and videos than any other country. Following calls from the government to stem the platform&rsquo;s misuse, WhatsApp has moved to deter mass message forwards and launched an advertising campaign to educate consumers.  In July, WhatsApp said message forwards will be limited to five chats at a time, whether among individuals or groups, and said it will remove the quick forward button placed next to media messages. Separately, India&rsquo;s federal police has begun probing Cambridge Analytica&rsquo;s misuse of Facebook user data, which New Delhi suspects included information on Indian users.

Ola has obtained licenses to begin operations in South Wales in September, as well as Greater Manchester, and plans to expand nationwide by the end of the year, it said in a statement. The firm will offer private vehicles for hire as well as Britain&rsquo;s famous black cabs on its platform, and will add more transportation options going forward. Ola and Uber, which both count Japan&rsquo;s SoftBank Group as an investor, have been competing in India&rsquo;s $12 billion taxi market and in recent months have taken their rivalry overseas. Ola is targeting high-booking markets in search of profitability because in India, less loyal consumers demanding low-cost rides makes competition more intense, said Neil Shah, research director at consultancy Counterpoint Research. In February, Ola launched operations in Australia, its first foray outside India and in one of Uber&rsquo;s strongholds where the Indian company now has 40,000 drivers on its platform across seven cities. Uber has a presence in Britain as well. &ldquo;This could put pressure on Uber and cause them to possibly merge in India,&rdquo; said Shah, adding that Ola could use its international expansion strategy into Uber territories as leverage. Uber, in March, decided to exit Southeast Asia, allowing it to focus on India. Ola, founded in 2011, clocks one billion rides each year globally, and has more than one million driver partners in over 110 cities, it said. The company is also expanding into food delivery, has partnered Microsoft Corp to build a platform for networked cars, and is experimenting with electric vehicles.

Financial markets expect another 40 basis points in rate increases from the U.S. Federal Reserve through the remainder of the year after two rate hikes so far in 2018. The euro EUR=EBS climbed a quarter of a percent higher at 1.1583 on Tuesday after falling to $1.1530 on Monday, its lowest since June 28 after monthly German industrial orders missed forecasts. The other big mover in currency markets was the Australian dollar AUD=D3 which rallied 0.5 percent to a one-week high at $0.7427 after the central bank kept policy settings on hold. With the Chinese yuan CNH=D3 also showing some signs of stabilizing after a recent fall due to escalating trade war concerns between the United States and its trading partners, the Aussie received some support.     However, some analysts see trade tensions supporting the dollar as the United States economy is better placed to handle protectionism than emerging markets, and as tariffs may narrow the U.S. trade deficit. &ldquo;There is still a lot of uncertainty on the tariffs. We don&rsquo;t know exactly how much will be implemented and how bad it can get,&rdquo; said Shinichiro Kadota, senior FX and rates strategist at Barclays in Tokyo.

Najib has been asked to appear at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) office at 5 p.m. (0900 GMT), a report on the website of The Star daily said. He will be released after MACC records his statement, it said.  One source aware of the matter confirmed the news report,  but offered no further details. MACC and Najib&rsquo;s spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Najib was arrested and charged in Malaysia last month with abuse of power and criminal breach of trust related to an alleged transfer of 42 million ringgit ($10.31 million) into his personal bank account from SRC International, a former unit of state fund 1MDB.  He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released after posting bail. He is scheduled to attend a pre-trial hearing in court on Wednesday. Najib and his family has faced intense scrutiny since a shock defeat in a May election by his former mentor-turned-foe, Mahathir Mohamad, who reopened an investigation into 1MDB after becoming prime minister. 1MDB is being investigated by at least six countries, including Singapore, Switzerland and the United States, over alleged money laundering and graft. The U.S. Department of Justice says an estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates.

The executive that took office in Rome in June has flagged ambitious spending plans that have raised concerns on financial markets.  In an interview with Radio24, Di Maio said the government would hold several meetings on the budget, including one on Wednesday. On Monday, he had said the government would only apply European Union fiscal rules if they did not impede its reform agenda. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said last week the government&rsquo;s ruling coalition had reached a compromise on the budget&rsquo;s outline. Investor unease at the mixed messages has driven a selloff of Italian debt that on Friday briefly pushed yields on 10-year bonds IT10YT=RR above 3 percent for the first time since June. While yields IT2YT=RR IT10YT=RR have since pulled back, analysts said on Tuesday the market remained vulnerable. Di Maio told Radio24 the government planned to cut company tax contributions for employees and reform pensions. He confirmed the executive would respect electoral pledges to cut corporate and individual income taxes while increasing financial support for the unemployed. It is unclear at this stage how these measures will be financed. Italy has the highest debt in the European Union after bailed-out Greece. The government needs to agree its fiscal plan for next year by September and must present a draft budget to the European Commission by mid-October. After the budget meeting last week, Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, an economics professor seen as more fiscally moderate than most of his cabinet colleagues, said the outline was compatible with EU targets, which require Italy to reduce its debt. But Di Maio cast doubt on that view on Monday, echoing remarks a day earlier from Matteo Salvini, who leads the other partner in the governing , the far-right League.

An escalating trade dispute with the United States, rising corporate borrowing costs and steep declines in Chinese stocks and the yuan have raised concerns that the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy could face a steeper slowdown than had been expected just a few months ago. &ldquo;The main focus will be on strengthening the overall coordination of policies,&rdquo; Ma Jun, a policy adviser to the People&rsquo;s Bank of China (PBOC), told a financial news outlet affiliated with Xinhua News Agency. The cabinet&rsquo;s Financial Stability and Development Commission (FSDC), which is headed by Vice Premier Liu He, should coordinate fiscal, monetary policies, Macro Prudential Assessment(MPA) and micro-level regulations, Ma said. China&rsquo;s leaders have pledged to make fiscal policy &ldquo;more active&rdquo;, following a debate among researchers from the central bank and finance ministry on whether fiscal policy should be used more actively to spur growth. China&rsquo;s small and private firms face increased financing difficulties as banks grow more concerned about credit quality, Ma said. Tighter official scrutiny of local government investment projects has also reduced their demand for loans.  The PBOC has been pumping out more cash by cutting banks&rsquo; reserve requirement ratios (RRR) this year, but it has long struggled to channel credit to small firms, which are vital for economic growth and job creation, analysts said. Larger state firms, meanwhile, have traditionally had much easier and cheaper access to credit. A central bank adviser said last week China should limit the credit impact of its multi-year campaign to reduce risks in the financial system, voicing concern that the tightening may have gone too far. Ma also said the central bank should further improve its  targeted RRR cuts and the MPA mechanism to better serve smaller firms. The MPAs are quarterly health checks of financial institutions to determine their risk exposure, and reporting requirements have been getting progressively tougher. In the long term, the PBOC bank should adopt a new benchmark policy rate as the intermediate policy target to replace the existing bank lending and deposit rates to help improve its policy mechanism, Ma added. China&rsquo;s new bank loans hit a five-month high in June, but annual growth in outstanding total social financing slowed to 9.8 percent, the slowest on record, while broad M2 money supply growth also hit a record low of 8 percent, indicating the regulatory tightening is having an impact.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made a priority of creating a society &ldquo;where women can shine&rdquo;, but women in Japan still face an uphill battle in employment and face hurdles returning to work after childbirth, which contributes to a falling birthrate. The alterations were uncovered in an internal investigation of a graft accusation this spring regarding the entrance exam for Tokyo Medical University, sparking protests and widespread anger following media reports last week. Lawyers investigating bribery accusations in the admission of the son of a senior education ministry official said they concluded that his score and that of several other men were boosted &ldquo;unfairly&rdquo; - some by as much as 49 points. They also concluded that scores were manipulated to give men more points than women and thus hold down the number of women admitted. &ldquo;This incident is really regrettable - by deceptive recruitment procedures, they sought to delude the test takers, their families, school officials and society as a whole,&rdquo; lawyer Kenji Nakai told a news conference. &ldquo;Factors suggesting very serious discrimination against women was also part of it,&rdquo; added Nakai, one of the external lawyers hired by the university to investigate the incident. The investigation showed the scores of men - including those reappearing after failing once or twice - were raised a certain number of points. Those of all women, and men who had failed the test at least three times, were not, however. The lawyers said they did not know how many women had been affected, but it appeared that women&rsquo;s test scores had been affected going back at least a decade. Medical school authorities have called a news conference for 5 p.m. No immediate comment was available from the government or the education ministry official who figures in the case. Entrance exam discrimination against women was &ldquo;absolutely unacceptable&rdquo;, Education Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters last week, however. Reports of the incident appeared at the start of August, setting off a furore in Japan, spurring women to recount their own experiences of discrimination on social media with the hashtag, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay to be angry about sexism.&rdquo;  Some referred to the potential costs exacted in a rapidly aging society.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m 29 and will probably never get married,&rdquo; said one poster. &ldquo;Women are pitied if they don&rsquo;t, but Japanese women who are married and working and have kids end up sleeping less than anybody in the world. To now hear that even our skills are suppressed makes me shake with rage.&rdquo; Another said,&rdquo;I ignored my parents, who said women don&rsquo;t belong in academia, and got into the best university in Japan.

The Mexico City-bound Embraer 190 passenger jet smashed into scrubland near the runway shortly after take-off during what passengers have described as strong winds, hail and rain. All 103 passengers and crew survived by evacuating from the plane before it caught fire. At least 65 passengers aboard Aeromexico Flight 2341 were U.S. citizens, including many residents from the Chicago area. &ldquo;All of the people on this flight have the right to know exactly what caused the plane to crash.

Investigators were waiting to interview the captain, who is still being treated in hospital, Fonseca said. Corboy & Demetrio said it filed six separate lawsuits on behalf of 11 passengers with the Cook County Circuit Court in Illinois.

News of Google&rsquo;s plan to return with a censored search app, criticized by human rights advocates as a blow to global free speech, comes at a time when China has stepped up scrutiny of business dealings involving U.S. tech firms including Facebook Inc (FB.O ), Apple Inc (AAPL.O ) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O ) amid intensifying trade tensions between the countries. Apple has removed hundreds of apps from its Chinese app store in the past year under increasingly strict censorship laws championed by Chinese president Xi Jinping.  Facebook, whose social media products are banned in China, is also making efforts to enter the restrictive market.  Last month, it said it was opening an innovation hub in the eastern city of Zhejiang, but only hours later the announcement of the project&rsquo;s registration was pulled by regulators from a national database.

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the lease contract that Landing signed with a state-owned foundation in March has significantly put the government at a disadvantage because the rental payment was &ldquo;unconscionable&rdquo;. &ldquo;Sorry to burst your bubble, people, but the president said that is grossly disadvantageous to the government,&rdquo; Roque told a media briefing, a few minutes after Landing broke ground for the fifth casino project at the 100-hectare Entertainment City strip located south of the capital Manila.  This is the second casino project under fire from Duterte&rsquo;s government. In April, it shelved a plan by Macau&rsquo;s Galaxy Entertainment Group to build a $500 million integrated casino-resort on the holiday island of Boracay, just a month after the gaming regulator approved the project. The government cited environmental concerns for the move. The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp, a government-owned and controlled firm under the Office of the President, granted Landing the license in July to build the casino. The integrated resort project is &ldquo;still pushing through and its lease contract with Nayong Pilipino Foundation is still valid and effective,&rdquo; Landing said in a statement. &ldquo;Unless the lease contract is canceled or nullified on solid legal grounds by the courts, Landing has reason to believe that it is a valid leaseholder and can legally proceed with its project,&rdquo; it added.

Europe&rsquo;s gains came on the heels of a stronger trading session in Asia as investors&rsquo; focus shifts from a murky, complex trade war to company earnings which they can more easily pin down and price in to markets.  UniCredit shares rose after Italy&rsquo;s biggest lender by assets reported second-quarter profits fell less than expected. &ldquo;Trend of under-promising and over-delivering continues,&rdquo; wrote Jefferies analysts.  Unicredit traded 1.8 percent higher by 0830 GMT as investors also digested the bank&rsquo;s weaker capital buffer. Its CET1 ratio fell due to the sharp sell-off in Italian government bonds on political upheaval. The Italian index rose 1 percent, out-doing the pan-European STOXX 600 which gained 0.4 percent.  Commerzbank shares fell 1.8 percent to the bottom of Germany&rsquo;s DAX, however, as investors reacted badly to a weaker-than-expected capital buffer, and its forecast of higher costs for its full year of 2018. &ldquo;We think investors will be disappointed by the revised cost guidance, as this is the main element in management&rsquo;s control, but note that expectations are already incredibly low for Commerzbank,&rdquo; said Citi analysts. Overall bank earnings have surprised positively against relatively pessimistic expectations. The biggest disappointment came from Danish jewelry maker Pandora, which sank 19 percent to a four-year low after cutting its sales and profit margin guidance for this year and announcing nearly 400 job cuts. &ldquo;Another profit warning just a few months after the updated mid-term targets may put the credibility of the current strategy and management team in question,&rdquo; said Berenberg analysts, warning of a likely &ldquo;free-fall&rdquo; in the stock today.  Pandora is suffering from fewer people visiting shopping malls in its key U.S. market. Industrial machinery and equipment maker Oerlikon jumped 9.2 percent after reporting orders, sales and earnings beats and hiking its order outlook.  &ldquo;European results have generally been good and reflect good underlying demand,&rdquo; said Christopher Dyer, director of global equity at Eaton Vance.  &ldquo;Sales in particular have been very healthy - beating estimates - while earnings per share has not quite kept up with sales growth.&rdquo;  Schaeffler shares climbed 6.6 percent after the car parts maker raised sales guidance for its industrial division. It helped boost the autos sector up 1.4 percent, among top gainers. Germany&rsquo;s DAX also jumped 1 percent thanks to its carmakers.  Daimler shares rose 1.7 percent after the carmaker said it has dropped plans to expand its Iran business in reaction to renewed U.S. sanctions. Meanwhile Europe&rsquo;s biggest pure online fashion retailer Zalando fell 6.2 percent after it trimmed its sales and profit outlook for the year, following results that missed expectations.  A downgrade by Credit Suisse to &ldquo;underperform&rdquo; bruised shares in French IT services firm Atos, down 7.4 percent. Analysts at the Swiss broker said &ldquo;financial arrangements&rdquo; account for around 30 percent of recent free cash flow and the majority of the recent improvement in cash flow.

The deal comes at a crucial time for the north London club as it embarks on life without long-time manager Arsene Wenger who stood down in April after 22 years in charge.  It also brings an end to the standoff between the two tycoons, who had both battled for control, and enables Kroenke to squeeze out the independent shareholders who had used the annual meeting to lambast the board for not spending more on a team that last won the Premier League in 2004.  The Arsenal Supporters&rsquo; Trust and one independent shareholder condemned the move, saying it would allow Kroenke to run the business with no oversight and to add debt to the balance sheet. The bid will be part funded by a 557 million pound loan from Deutsche Bank.  Kroenke, a 67-percent shareholder in Arsenal who also owns the U.S. Denver Nuggets basketball team and the Los Angeles Rams American Football team, said in a statement to the London stock exchange that a single owner would be able to pursue its strategy more quickly. &ldquo;We appreciate Mr Usmanov&rsquo;s dedication to the Arsenal Football Club and the storied ethos and history the club represents,&rdquo; he said.  Initially viewed with suspicion by the board, Kroenke started building up his position from 2007 as he slowly bought out the families who had run the 132-year-old club for generations.   He said on Tuesday he had now received an irrevocable undertaking from Usmanov to sell his 30 percent stake and would buy out the remaining independent shareholders at 29,000 pounds per share. Usmanov, who is ranked by Forbes as Russia&rsquo;s 10th richest man with a fortune of $12.5 billion, owns stakes in some of Russia&rsquo;s biggest companies including phone operator Megafon, iron ore producer Metalloinvest and Internet group Mail.ru, among other investments. FOREIGN OWNERS Kroenke is competing against the billionaire owners of other Premier League clubs such as Chelsea&rsquo;s Roman Abramovich, Manchester United&rsquo;s Glazer family and Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi, who owns last season&rsquo;s runaway winners, Manchester City.  Arsenal fans have long complained that the club has not plowed enough money into the team and even let some of the best players leave to join rivals, including Robin van Persie and Alexis Sanchez who both joined Manchester United. Arsenal finished the 2017\/18 season in sixth place behind the two Manchester clubs, fierce local rivals Tottenham Hostpur, Liverpool and Chelsea. That marked the second season running it had missed out on the lucrative European Champions League. David Kershaw, an independent shareholder, fan and chief executive of advertising group M&C Saatchi, told Reuters he was concerned that the deal would not lead to a better performance on the pitch.  &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s very sad that we&rsquo;re in danger of losing any transparency into how our club is run,&rdquo; he said. His comments were echoed by the Arsenal Supporters&rsquo; Trust, an independent group representing fans who fear their influence will be diminished. &ldquo;Many of these fans ... hold their shares not for value but as custodians who care for the future of the club. Kroenke&rsquo;s actions will neuter their voice and involvement,&rdquo; the Trust said in a statement. While many Americans run clubs, or franchises, like a business, the richer owners of Chelsea and Manchester City have thrown hundreds of millions of pounds at their clubs to buy the world&rsquo;s best players.  Founded by a group of workers at the Royal Arsenal armaments factory in Woolwich, the Arsenal team were League champions on 13 occasions, including three under Wenger, and FA Cup winners a record 13 times. New manager Unai Emery, who joined from Paris St Germain, will be given a baptism of fire this weekend when Arsenal kick off their new season against Manchester City.

But for the quarter as a whole, industrial output rose by 0.4 percent, the economy ministry said. That means manufacturing contributed to an expected acceleration in gross domestic product growth during the April-June period. The release followed data on Monday that showed German industrial orders dropped in June by the most in nearly a year and a half, suggesting that trade tensions caused by U.S. President Donald Trump might limit growth. &ldquo;June&rsquo;s industrial production and trade figures suggest that the previously booming German economy is already feeling the effects of trade tensions,&rdquo; said Jennifer McKeown at London-based Capital Economics. &ldquo;But with the domestic economy in good shape and given the recent ceasefire in the tariff war, we expect only a modest slowdown in German growth.&rdquo;  The Economy Ministry said on Tuesday industrial output fell 0.9 percent on the month in June, missing a Reuters forecast for a drop of 0.5 percent. That came after a downwardly revised rise of 2.4 percent in May. A breakdown of the June data showed manufacturing fell by 0.8 percent and construction dropped by 3.2 percent. But energy production jumped by 2.9 percent. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a great result, but it could have been worse,&rdquo; Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said. &ldquo;In contrast to the first quarter, industrial production supported growth in the second quarter.&rdquo; GROWTH EXPECTED The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary gross domestic product growth data for the second quarter next Tuesday. Analysts polled by Reuters on average expect the quarterly growth rate to edge up to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent in the first quarter, driven by private consumption and construction. The German economy expanded by a robust 2.5 percent in 2017 and most analysts expect only a moderate slowdown to around 2 percent this year. The Federal Statistics Office said in a separate statement that seasonally adjusted exports were unchanged on the month in June while imports rose by 1.2 percent. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus narrowed to 19.3 billion euros from an upwardly revised 20.4 billion euros  ($23.60 billion) in May. In the first half of the year, the trade surplus was nearly unchanged at 121.5 billion euros after 121.3 billion euros in the first six months of the previous year, unadjusted data showed. Trump has agreed to refrain from imposing tariffs on cars imported from the EU while the two sides negotiated to cut other trade barriers.

Major cited unpublished government research that showed the northeast - another region hit hard by mine closures - might lose 16 percent of its gross domestic product if Britain left the EU without a deal. There is little sign of Brexit regret in Goole. In an unscientific poll of 35 voters there, 11 told Reuters they had no view on Brexit, 15 wanted it as soon as possible, five said they voted to remain and four would consider switching to remain from leave if there were another vote. &ldquo;We should leave: we voted to leave, it is a democracy.

The Mendocino Complex grew to span 283,000 acres (114,526 hectares) on Monday when two wildfires merged at the southern tip of the Mendocino National Forest, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.  It is the largest of eight major fires burning out of control across California, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to declare a &ldquo;major disaster&rdquo; in the state.  The size of the fire has surpassed that of last year&rsquo;s Thomas Fire, which burned 281,893 acres in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties when it destroyed more than 1,000 structures.  The Mendocino Complex has burned 75 homes and forced thousands to be evacuated.  Temperatures could reach 110 degrees (43 Celsius) in Northern California over the next few days with gusty winds fanning the flames of the complex, a National Weather Service meteorologist said.    The 3,900 crews battling the Mendocino Complex on Monday were focusing on keeping flames from breaking through fire lines on a ridge above the foothill communities of Nice, Lucerne, Glen Haven, and Clearlake Oaks, said Tricia Austin, a spokeswoman for Cal Fire.  Elsewhere in California, evacuations were ordered for cabins in Cleveland National Forest canyons in Orange County on Monday afternoon after a blaze broke out and quickly spread to span 700 acres (283 hectares). The Carr Fire - which has torched 164,413 acres in the scenic Shasta-Trinity region north of Sacramento since breaking out on July 23 - was 47 percent contained. The Carr Fire has been blamed for seven deaths, including a 21-year-old Pacific Gas and Electric Company lineman Jay Ayeta, whom the company said on Sunday was killed in a vehicle crash as he worked with crews in dangerous terrain.    &ldquo;California wildfires are being magnified and made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren&rsquo;t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized,&rdquo; Trump wrote on Twitter. A California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection spokesman declined to comment on Trump&rsquo;s tweet but said crews did not lack water to fight the flames. Environmental activists and some politicians say the  intensity of the state&rsquo;s wildfire season could be linked in part to climate change.

(Reuters) - Rick Gates, a longtime business associate of U.S. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, on Monday testified that he helped Manafort file false tax returns and hide his foreign bank accounts. Gates is the government&rsquo;s star witness in its case against Manafort, who is accused of bank and tax fraud. Gates, who also served on Trump&rsquo;s campaign, pleaded guilty in February and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors under a deal that could lead to a reduced sentence. Taking the stand on the trial&rsquo;s fifth day, Gates admitted to helping Manafort doctor financial statements, hide foreign income and cheat on his taxes. He said he was aware Manafort was acting as an unregistered foreign agent in lobbying for Ukraine. He said he engaged in the wrongdoing at Manafort&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;At Mr. Manafort&rsquo;s request we did not disclose foreign bank accounts,&rdquo; Gates told the jury in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.  Manafort&rsquo;s defense hinges on pinning the blame on Gates, who they accuse of embezzling millions of dollars from Manafort.  Gates, who first met Manafort working for him as an intern fresh out of college, has been described by witnesses as Manafort&rsquo;s right-hand man in his multimillion-dollar political consulting business. Throughout his testimony, Gates largely avoided making eye contact with Manafort, who appeared to be watching him.  In addition to assisting in Manafort&rsquo;s alleged crimes, Gates told the jury he had failed to report income he routed through his bank accounts in the United Kingdom and said he stole several hundreds of thousands of dollars from Manafort by filing false and inflated expense reports. Those admissions are likely to become a focal point for Manafort&rsquo;s defense team when he is cross examined on Tuesday. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. The charges largely predate his five months on the Trump campaign. His case is the first to go to trial arising from Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The jury has heard how Manafort made tens of millions of dollars for work with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Mueller is also investigating possible coordination between Trump campaign members and Russian officials in the election campaign, but the charges against Manafort do not address that. CYPRUS ACCOUNTS Gates also testified about how wealthy Ukrainian businessmen paid Manafort millions of dollars for his political services through wire transfers to Cyprus-based accounts that were set up for Manafort by a lawyer and local politician known as &ldquo;Dr. K.&rdquo; &ldquo;He indicated that the Ukrainian businessmen...had directed him to set up Cyprus accounts because the payments would be coming from Cyprus,&rdquo; Gates said when asked to explain the payment structure. Gates also testified that both he and Manafort had control over the foreign accounts, as well as Manafort&rsquo;s business associate Konstantin Kilimnik. Kilimnik is a Russian-Ukrainian political consultant who was indicted in June on charges stemming from the Mueller probe. In court filings, Mueller has accused Kilimnik of having ties to Russian intelligence services, an allegation he has denied. Gates testified that Manafort told him to report overseas income as loans to lower Manafort&rsquo;s taxable income, supporting the testimony of his accountant.  &ldquo;When income came into the company, Mr. Manafort directed whether it would be treated as income ...or loans,&rdquo; Gates said. The jury heard testimony on Friday and Monday from accountant Cynthia Laporta, who described how Manafort and Gates doctored financial statements and backdated loans.  Gates admitted in testimony on Friday that he had lied to Laporta, as well as other accountants and Manafort&rsquo;s bookkeeper. In questioning Laporta on Monday, a prosecutor asked her about a $10 million loan purportedly received by Manafort from Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska in 2006. Laporta said she had no indication that the loan from Deripaska had been paid off. Since the trial started before U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis last Tuesday, Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers have kept their cross-examinations brief and at times refrained from attempting to rebut damaging testimony in detail. But Laporta&rsquo;s testimony raised the stakes for Manafort. Testifying under immunity, she was the first witness to admit she knew accounting maneuvers Manafort and Gates requested of her were wrong and could be crimes. One accounting trick saved Manafort $500,000 in taxes, she said. Under cross examination on Monday, defense attorney Kevin Downing attempted to show that Gates was the point person in dealing with the accountants. But while Laporta acknowledged that she regularly communicated with Gates, she said she believed Manafort was in the know. &ldquo;In most instances it was clear Mr. Manafort knew what was going on,&rdquo; Laporta said. Slideshow (4 Images)  On redirect, prosecutor Uzo Asonye used a spreadsheet to show that Manafort&rsquo;s firm had earned $31 million in gross receipts between 2010 and 2014 - half the amount prosecutors say he netted during the same time frame in Ukraine.

Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were up 50 cents to $74.25 per barrel at 0928 GMT (5.28 a.m. ET) and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were up 29 cents at $69.30 a barrel. A first batch of U.S. sanctions against Iran, which shipped out almost 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July, officially came into effect at 12:01 a.m. U.S. Eastern time (0401 GMT) on Tuesday. The reimposed sanctions target Iran&rsquo;s U.S. dollar purchases, metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector. &ldquo;It is a reality check that this is happening and that Iran&rsquo;s oil exports will be hurt when the oil sanctions hit it in November,&rdquo; chief commodities analyst at Commerzbank Bjarne Schieldrop said. Many countries, including U.S. allies in Europe as well as China and India, oppose the sanctions, but the U.S. government said it wants as many countries as possible to stop buying Iranian oil. &ldquo;It is our policy to get as many countries to zero as quickly as possible. We are going to work with individual countries on a case-by-case basis, but our goal is to reduce the amount of revenue and hard currency going into Iran,&rdquo; a senior U.S. administration official said on Monday. &ldquo;A full embargo seems unlikely and the oil market should remain well balanced in light of rising production and the emerging markets&rsquo; fuel inflation pains,&rdquo; Norbert Rucker, head of macro and commodity research at bank Julius Baer, said.  HEAT IMPACTS OIL Analysts also warned that a global heatwave could affect oil demand. Much of the northern hemisphere has been gripped by extreme heat this summer, pushing up demand for industrial and residential cooling.  This mostly impacts demand for power fuels such as thermal coal and natural gas. &ldquo;With global demand remaining healthy and the global heatwave increasing oil demand, I think prices will remain well-supported in the near term,&rdquo; Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM said.  But U.S. bank JPMorgan said a warmer-than-usual fourth quarter could stem from a potential El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern that &ldquo;can cause droughts, flooding and other natural disasters across the globe, including heatwaves in the U.S. that affect commodities&rdquo;. &ldquo;Past instances of El Ni\u00f1o have resulted in sharp drops in U.S. residential and commercial heating oil demand and prices,&rdquo; it said.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made a priority of creating a society &ldquo;where women can shine&rdquo;, but women in Japan still face an uphill battle in employment and face hurdles returning to work after childbirth, a factor behind a falling birthrate. The alterations were uncovered in an internal investigation of a graft accusation this spring regarding the entrance exam for Tokyo Medical University, sparking protests and anger. Lawyers investigating bribery accusations in the admission of the son of a senior education ministry official said they concluded that his score, and those of several other men, were boosted &ldquo;unfairly&rdquo; - by as much as 49 points, in one case. They also concluded that scores were manipulated to give men more points than women and thus hold down the number of women admitted, since school officials felt they were more likely to quit the profession after having children, or for other reasons. &ldquo;This incident is really regrettable - by deceptive recruitment procedures, they sought to delude the test takers, their families, school officials and society as a whole,&rdquo; lawyer Kenji Nakai told a news conference.

The investigation showed that the scores of men, including those reappearing after failing once or twice, were raised, while those of all women, and men who had failed the test at least three times, were not. The lawyers said they did not know how many women had been affected, but it appeared that women&rsquo;s test scores had been affected going back at least a decade. At a news conference, senior school officials bowed and apologized, pledging to &ldquo;sincerely&rdquo; consider their response, such as possible compensation. However, they said they had been unaware of the manipulation. &ldquo;Society is changing rapidly and we need to respond to that and any organization that fails to utilize women will grow weak,&rdquo; said Tetsuo Yukioka, the school&rsquo;s executive regent and chair of its diversity promotion panel. &ldquo;I guess that thinking had not been absorbed.&rdquo; No immediate comment was available from the government or the education ministry official who figures in the case.

Vacancies surged by 25,000 on the quarter and by 115,000 on the year to reach 1.21 million in the April-June period, a survey by the IAB labor office research institute found. Industrial output data released earlier on Tuesday and industrial orders figures on Monday suggested German economic growth weakened towards the end of the second quarter as a result of trade tensions caused by U.S. President Donald Trump. Asked for the main reasons that are complicating recruitment, most employers pointed to a lack of applicants and insufficient job qualifications, the survey showed. On average, there are almost three job vacancies in Germany for every 100 employees with a labor contract that includes contributions to the state&rsquo;s social security system. In 2012, there were only two vacancies. &ldquo;This shows that demand for staff has significantly increased,&rdquo; IAB said in a research note. Germany&rsquo;s labor market is booming, with employment reaching record highs. An unusually long economic growth cycle, now in its ninth year, coupled with a shortage of working-age people, means many companies are running out of suitable staff. Many firms are facing difficulties in filling their training positions, with a recent survey by the German Chambers of Commerce showing more than a third of German companies could not fill all of their training places last year. Almost one in ten received no applications for such roles. The IW German Economic Institute estimated in April that the shortage of manpower is costing the economy up to 0.9 percentage points of output a year.

The Ohio race for a U.S. House of Representatives seat headlines a day of voting across the country that also features primaries in four other states. Other key contests include a Democratic battle for governor in Michigan between a progressive and a mainstream candidate and a high-profile conservative challenge to the incumbent Republican governor in Kansas. Trump charged into the Ohio race, the final special election before November. He visited the reliably Republican 12th Congressional District over the weekend to try to head off an upset after polls showed a tightening battle between Republican Troy Balderson and Democrat Danny O&rsquo;Connor. The district, split between suburban Columbus and rural areas, has been represented by a Republican since the early 1980s. Trump carried it by 11 percentage points in the 2016 presidential race. But O&rsquo;Connor has wiped out most or all of Balderson&rsquo;s lead in polls, and a Democratic win would set off alarm bells for Republicans already worried by a series of strong performances in special elections by Democrats in the Trump era. &ldquo;A month ago this race was flying under the radar, but it has become nationalized and become more of a referendum on Trump, which really generates Democratic enthusiasm,&rdquo; said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. A Monmouth poll last week showed the race was essentially a dead heat, down from a double-digit advantage for Balderson a month ago. In addition to more Democrats expressing high interest in the race, Murray said the shift was driven by independents unhappy with the status quo under Trump. Democrats must pick up 23 seats in the House and two seats in the U.S. Senate to gain control of those chambers and put a brake on Trump&rsquo;s agenda. All 435 House seats, 35 of 100 Senate seats and 36 of 50 governors&rsquo; offices are up for grabs in the Nov. 6 midterms. Other well-known Republicans also trekked to Ohio, including Vice President Mike Pence. A Republican advocacy group aired an ad featuring praise for Balderson, a state lawmaker, from Ohio Governor John Kasich, a frequent critic of Trump. Republicans have tried to paint O&rsquo;Connor, a local county official, as a liberal who would follow House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. But O&rsquo;Connor has walked a more moderate line, saying he wants new party leadership in Congress and would work with Republicans, while also criticizing the Trump tax cut. Michigan, Missouri, Kansas and Washington also hold primaries on Tuesday. The Democratic race for governor in Michigan offers the next test of the electoral power of the party&rsquo;s progressive wing, with health director Abdul El-Sayed vying to become the country&rsquo;s first Muslim governor against a more moderate Democrat, former state Senate leader Gretchen Whitmer. El-Sayed was endorsed by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and campaigned recently with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young democratic socialist whose shocking New York primary upset in June made her a movement star. In Kansas, prominent conservative Kris Kobach, a national leader in the movement to restrict illegal immigration and pass more restrictive voting laws, is challenging Governor Jeff Colyer for the Republican gubernatorial nomination on Tuesday. Trump endorsed Kobach, Kansas&rsquo; secretary of state, on Monday.

The Ohio race for a U.S. House of Representatives seat headlines a day of voting across the country that also features primaries in four other states. Other key contests include a Democratic battle for governor in Michigan between a progressive and a mainstream candidate and a high-profile conservative challenge to the incumbent Republican governor in Kansas. Trump charged into the Ohio race, the final special election before November. He visited the reliably Republican 12th Congressional District over the weekend to try to head off an upset after polls showed a tightening battle between Republican Troy Balderson and Democrat Danny O&rsquo;Connor. The district, split between suburban Columbus and rural areas, has been represented by a Republican since the early 1980s. Trump carried it by 11 percentage points in the 2016 presidential race. But O&rsquo;Connor has wiped out most or all of Balderson&rsquo;s lead in polls, and a Democratic win would set off alarm bells for Republicans already worried by a series of strong performances in special elections by Democrats in the Trump era. &ldquo;A month ago this race was flying under the radar, but it has become nationalized and become more of a referendum on Trump, which really generates Democratic enthusiasm,&rdquo; said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. A Monmouth poll last week showed the race was essentially a dead heat, down from a double-digit advantage for Balderson a month ago. In addition to more Democrats expressing high interest in the race, Murray said the shift was driven by independents unhappy with the status quo under Trump. Democrats must pick up 23 seats in the House and two seats in the U.S. Senate to gain control of those chambers and put a brake on Trump&rsquo;s agenda. All 435 House seats, 35 of 100 Senate seats and 36 of 50 governors&rsquo; offices are up for grabs in the Nov. 6 midterms. Other well-known Republicans also trekked to Ohio, including Vice President Mike Pence. A Republican advocacy group aired an ad featuring praise for Balderson, a state lawmaker, from Ohio Governor John Kasich, a frequent critic of Trump. Republicans have tried to paint O&rsquo;Connor, a local county official, as a liberal who would follow House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. But O&rsquo;Connor has walked a more moderate line, saying he wants new party leadership in Congress and would work with Republicans, while also criticizing the Trump tax cut. Michigan, Missouri, Kansas and Washington also hold primaries on Tuesday. The Democratic race for governor in Michigan offers the next test of the electoral power of the party&rsquo;s progressive wing, with health director Abdul El-Sayed vying to become the country&rsquo;s first Muslim governor against a more moderate Democrat, former state Senate leader Gretchen Whitmer. El-Sayed was endorsed by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and campaigned recently with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young democratic socialist whose shocking New York primary upset in June made her a movement star. In Kansas, prominent conservative Kris Kobach, a national leader in the movement to restrict illegal immigration and pass more restrictive voting laws, is challenging Governor Jeff Colyer for the Republican gubernatorial nomination on Tuesday. Trump endorsed Kobach, Kansas&rsquo; secretary of state, on Monday. Kobach was an immigration adviser to Trump&rsquo;s campaign in 2016 and was vice chairman of Trump&rsquo;s commission to investigate voting fraud before the panel collapsed.

(Reuters) - Rick Gates, a former business associate to U.S. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s ex-campaign manager Paul Manafort, will continue to testify against his former boss and is expected to face a tough cross examination on Tuesday. Gates, 46, testified on Monday that he helped falsify Manafort&rsquo;s tax returns and hide his foreign bank accounts used to receive income from wealthy pro-Russia Ukrainian businessmen. Gates, who also was an official on Trump&rsquo;s campaign, pleaded guilty in February to lying to investigators and conspiring to defraud the United States and agreed to cooperate in Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s ongoing investigation into whether Trump&rsquo;s campaign colluded with Russia.  On Monday Gates testified that he has met with prosecutors about 20 times. It is unclear what other information he may have provided to Mueller&rsquo;s team. Manafort, 69, has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank fraud, tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. Prosecutors are expected to continue questioning Gates on Tuesday morning before Manafort&rsquo;s defense attorneys get their chance to cross-examine him. Throughout the trial, they have tried to pin the blame for financial misdeeds on Gates, whom they also have accused of embezzling millions from Manafort&rsquo;s consulting firm. Gates admitted on Monday that he did steal money through inflated expense reports, but he said it was hundreds of thousands of dollars, not millions. Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers are expected to use the theft to try to undermine Gates&rsquo; credibility as a witness. They also are likely to bring up his making false statements to investigators.    Some observers who watched Gates&rsquo; testimony on Monday said they thought he was credible. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not an honest person,&rdquo; said Susan Elson, 69, a retired attorney who came from Annapolis to watch the trial. &ldquo;But I think he has totally folded. I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s holding anything back at this point.&rdquo; Prosecutors have accused Manafort and Gates of conspiring to hide a significant portion of the $60 million that Manafort earned through his political lobbying in the Ukraine for its then-President Viktor Yanukovych. Later, when Yanukovych fell out of power and fled to Russia, the business struggled and prosecutors say Manafort lied to banks to obtain loans to help maintain his life of luxury. One issue that could become an ongoing challenge for prosecutors on Tuesday is the extent to which they are allowed to admit evidence about Manafort&rsquo;s Ukraine work and the oligarchs who paid him. On Monday, Judge T.S. Ellis repeatedly clashed with prosecutors about the relevance of such testimony and once again urged them to speed things along.  Later, with the jury out of earshot, Ellis raised his voice at Greg Andres, scolding him for looking down when he was speaking to him and unnecessarily dragging the wealthy Ukrainian businessmen&rsquo;s names &ldquo;through the mud.&rdquo; Andres told him it was crucial to be allowed explain the role that oligarchs play in Ukraine&rsquo;s political system. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s appropriate to not explain to the jury why these people are paying Mr. Manafort,&rdquo; Andres said.

Green, who runs a Miners&rsquo; Welfare Club in an area where there are no longer any working miners, says both of Britain&rsquo;s main political parties have shown no interest in the Yorkshire town of Knottingley for generations. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s desperate really - I feel that Knottingley is a forgotten community, and all the surrounding areas are forgotten communities as well, through lack of investment and red tape,&rdquo; he said, standing in a youth boxing gym at the club. The 55-year-old former railwayman is not alone. Such anger drove many Britons to vote to leave the European Union in 2016, though tumult in the Brexit process has prompted some supporters of EU membership to call for a rerun of the referendum. With Britain due to leave on March 29, 2019, the country, its politicians and its business leaders remain deeply divided over Brexit. Recent opinion polls show voters think Prime Minister Theresa May is handling the process badly and there may be a slight move toward support for staying in the EU. May, who has ruled out another referendum, is trying to clinch a Brexit divorce deal with Brussels that pleases both sides of her divided Conservative Party as well as the Northern Irish kingmakers who prop up her minority government. &ldquo;SHAMBOLIC JOKE&rdquo; Local people complain there are few jobs in Knottingley. Like many areas in northern England, it has been left behind by a global economy that has brought cheaper coal imports from the likes of Colombia and Russia, and a push toward generating power from cleaner gas and wind turbines.  People drink in the bar at the Kellingley Social Club in Knottingley, Britain August 1, 2018.  REUTERS\/Phil Noble Unemployment in Yorkshire and neighboring Humberside is 4.5 percent, only slightly more than the national rate. But while the county includes the vibrant city of Leeds and the prosperous spa town of Harrogate, life is tougher in the old mining areas. Green&rsquo;s club originally catered for workers at Kellingley Colliery just outside the town, which was Britain&rsquo;s last deep coal mine. It closed in 2015, leaving only open cast operations as a remnant of the country&rsquo;s once dominant coal industry. Kellingley stands chained shut behind rusting metal fences. Giant slag heaps and chimneys remain, with signs proclaiming regeneration initiatives. Green casts the wider United Kingdom as crumbling: a London-focused media, bureaucrats who ignore the wishes of the people, and police and health services stretched to breaking point. Politicians live in a bubble, he said. &ldquo;We are just totally let down aren&rsquo;t we and they are not listening.&rdquo;   Green, who voted &ldquo;leave&rdquo; in 2016 because he wanted money paid to Europe reinvested in his community, is dismayed by the chaos in both the Conservative and Labour parties and by May&rsquo;s Brexit negotiation. &ldquo;It is just a shambolic joke now - every time you put telly on there is inhouse fighting,&rdquo; Green said. &ldquo;I would still vote to go out.&rdquo; What would he tell May about Brexit? &ldquo;Just get on with it. We are a nation of fighters - we are not going to crumble. Let&rsquo;s crack on, get out and get some investment back into this country,&rdquo; he said. Slideshow (27 Images)  REGREXIT?

The German engineering group is just one of a number of companies to warn of the dangers of leaving the EU without a deal with Brussels. Others say Brexit could hurt communities like Knottingley or Goole much more than London or Leeds, which voted to remain in the EU.    &ldquo;If we crash out without a deal the people who have least are going to be hurt most,&rdquo; former Conservative prime minister John Major said, adding he did not rule out another referendum. Major cited unpublished government research that showed the northeast - another region hit hard by mine closures - might lose 16 percent of its gross domestic product if Britain left the EU without a deal. There is little sign of Brexit regret in Goole. In an unscientific poll of 35 voters there, 11 told Reuters they had no view on Brexit, 15 wanted it as soon as possible, five said they voted to remain and four would consider switching to remain from leave if there were another vote. &ldquo;We should leave: we voted to leave, it is a democracy.

The Alibaba units to be merged include food delivery platform Ele.me and food and lifestyle services firm Koubei, the people said. Alibaba is looking to raise between $3 billion and $5 billion for the combined entity, said one source. The entity could be valued at up to $25 billion, said another.

China&rsquo;s biggest ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing also entered the fray in April launching its own food delivery service.   Meituan Dianping is expected to raise more than $4 billion when it floats in Hong Kong in the coming months. Last year the company was valued at $30 billion in a fundraising round. In April, Alibaba bought the shares it did not already own in Ele.me in an all-cash deal that valued the startup at $9.5 billion.

Hamas and Palestinian health officials in Gaza confirmed the deaths near Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza, shortly before noon.  A statement by the Israeli military said: &ldquo;A short while ago, terrorists fired shots towards IDF (Israel Defence Forces) soldiers near the northern Gaza Strip from a Hamas post. In response, an IDF tank targeted the post from which the shots were fired.&rdquo; The military released footage that it said was of the incident. One of the grainy black and white video clips shows two men in a watchtower, one appears to open fire as puffs of smoke burst in front of him. The video then cuts to separate footage of a shell hitting the post and an explosion. Reuters was immediately unable to verify the footage.  In Gaza, Hamas&rsquo;s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, issued a statement saying that it &ldquo;mourns the two Mujahedeen&rdquo; and that they had been &ldquo;martyred in a Zionist bombardment.&rdquo; No militant group claimed responsibility. U.N. and Egyptian-led efforts are under way to mediate a long-term truce between Israel and Hamas that would end a four-month upsurge of violence along the Israel-Gaza border.  At least 158 Palestinians have been killed in four months of weekly border protests and one Israeli soldier was shot dead by a Gaza sniper.  Israel says Hamas, which rules Gaza, is using the protests as cover to carry out cross-border attacks. Hamas denies this.  Palestinians militants have also fired rockets into Israel and the Israeli military has carried out dozens of air strikes in the enclave.  Israel has lost tracts of farmland and forest to fires started by kites and helium balloons laden with incendiary material which have caused fires in Israeli forests and farmlands and flown over the border by Palestinians in Gaza.

Hamas and Palestinian health officials in Gaza confirmed the deaths near Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza, shortly before noon.  A statement by the Israeli military said: &ldquo;A short while ago, terrorists fired shots towards IDF (Israel Defence Forces) soldiers near the northern Gaza Strip from a Hamas post. In response, an IDF tank targeted the post from which the shots were fired.&rdquo; The military released footage that it said was of the incident. One of the grainy black and white video clips shows two men in a watchtower, one appears to open fire as puffs of smoke burst in front of him. The video then cuts to separate footage of a shell hitting the post and an explosion. Reuters was immediately unable to verify the footage.  In Gaza, Hamas&rsquo;s military wing, the Qassam Brigades, issued a statement saying that it &ldquo;mourns the two Mujahedeen&rdquo; and that they had been &ldquo;martyred in a Zionist bombardment.&rdquo; No militant group claimed responsibility. U.N. and Egyptian-led efforts are under way to mediate a long-term truce between Israel and Hamas that would end a four-month upsurge of violence along the Israel-Gaza border.  At least 158 Palestinians have been killed in four months of weekly border protests and one Israeli soldier was shot dead by a Gaza sniper.  Israel says Hamas, which rules Gaza, is using the protests as cover to carry out cross-border attacks. Hamas denies this.  Palestinians militants have also fired rockets into Israel and the Israeli military has carried out dozens of air strikes in the enclave.  Israel has lost tracts of farmland and forest to fires started by kites and helium balloons laden with incendiary material which have caused fires in Israeli forests and farmlands and flown over the border by Palestinians in Gaza.

The Alibaba units to be merged include food delivery platform Ele.me and food and lifestyle services firm Koubei, the people said. Alibaba is looking to raise between $3 billion and $5 billion for the combined entity, said one source. The entity could be valued at up to $25 billion, said another. A Hong Kong-based Alibaba task force is working on the merger and fundraising for the combined entity, according to two of the people.     Alibaba&rsquo;s units and Meituan, backed by social media and gaming giant Tencent Holdings (0700.HK ), are fighting for supremacy in China&rsquo;s buoyant online-to-offline (O2O) market where apps link smartphone users with bricks-and-mortar businesses to provide local food delivery and other offerings. &ldquo;Alibaba and Meituan are the two main companies that can offer comprehensive O2O services,&rdquo; said Mo Jia, a Shanghai-based research analyst with technology consultancy Canalys. &ldquo;Alibaba&rsquo;s three units are complementary to each other and it has strategic logic to merge them into one platform to compete with Meituan.&rdquo; SoftBank Group Corp&rsquo;s (9984.T ) Vision Fund is expected to be the lead investor in the fundraising, according to two sources. Other potential investors include Chinese private equity firm Primavera Capital Group, two other sources said.   One of the people told Reuters earlier the new unit would also include Alibaba&rsquo;s Hema Fresh, a chain of cashless supermarkets offering fresh produce and food delivery. The other sources said on Tuesday Hema was not part of the combined unit seeking funding. Alibaba, which also handles media queries for Koubei and Hema, declined to comment. A spokesman for Ele.me denied the merger and fundraising plan. All the people declined to be named as the information is confidential. Slideshow (3 Images)  A SoftBank spokeswoman declined to comment. Primavera did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BOOMING O2O The value of O2O transactions in China jumped 72 percent last year to $146 billion, according to Chinese research firm Analysys. According to a June report by Chinese research firm iiMedia Research, Ele.me and Baidu Waimai, which Ele.me acquired a year ago, held a combined 55 percent of China&rsquo;s food delivery market in the first quarter compared with Meituan&rsquo;s 41 percent. China&rsquo;s biggest ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing also entered the fray in April launching its own food delivery service.   Meituan Dianping is expected to raise more than $4 billion when it floats in Hong Kong in the coming months. Last year the company was valued at $30 billion in a fundraising round. In April, Alibaba bought the shares it did not already own in Ele.me in an all-cash deal that valued the startup at $9.5 billion. The e-commerce giant and its financial affiliate Ant Financial Services Group previously owned a 43 stake in the business, whose name roughly translates to &ldquo;Hungry?&rdquo;. Koubei, founded in 2015 as a 50-50 joint venture of Alibaba and Ant Financial, had a valuation of $8 billion at the end of 2017, according to a list of unicorns published by a unit under China&rsquo;s Ministry of Science & Technology in March. Silver Lake, CDH Investments, Yunfeng Capital and Primavera Capital joined as investors in a January 2017 funding round. Ant Financial declined to comment.  There are no publicly available numbers for Hema, which was founded two years ago as part of Alibaba&rsquo;s retail push and now operates more than 60 supermarkets in 13 cities in China, according to its website.

He was 96. Laxalt died on Monday in McLean, Virginia of natural causes, the New York Times reported.  Laxalt, the son of a Basque immigrant sheepherder, became Reagan&rsquo;s political soulmate and close friend when they served as governors of neighboring Western states - Laxalt in Nevada from 1967 to 1971, and Reagan, a former actor, in California. Laxalt, who served in the Senate from 1974 through 1987, headed Reagan&rsquo;s unsuccessful campaign for the 1976 Republican presidential nomination against incumbent President Gerald Ford, as well as Reagan&rsquo;s successful White House bids in 1980 and 1984. Laxalt was called the &ldquo;first friend&rdquo; and his ties to Reagan provided him with a special niche as an influential liaison between the White House and Congress during the first six years of Reagan&rsquo;s presidency. The two men shared not only a dedication to free enterprise and conservatism but a laid-back, genial manner and a love of horseback riding and the outdoor lifestyle of the American West. &ldquo;He was a kind, decent man,&rdquo; Laxalt said of Reagan in a 2008 interview with Nevada Magazine. &ldquo;He never professed to know more than he should and he was very considerate of everybody else&rsquo;s opinion. He was more than a Hollywood-type figure.&rdquo; Laxalt said he felt like a brother to Reagan and told the New York Times in 1982: &ldquo;Because of my relationship with the president, I can say things in a manner that others can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; William Cohen, a fellow Republican who also served in the Senate then, said at the time of Laxalt: &ldquo;He plays a very important offstage role. He helps modulate (Reagan) administration policy and keeps them in tune with the Senate, so they understand when to push and when not to push.&rdquo; &lsquo;THE TIME HAS COME&rsquo; Reagan sent Laxalt on a delicate diplomatic mission to the Philippines in 1985 to urge Marcos, a long-time U.S. ally, to reform his government amid the &ldquo;People Power&rdquo; uprising. In February 1986, after Marcos retained his presidency in a dubious electoral victory, Laxalt helped engineer the long-serving dictator&rsquo;s resignation. With instability growing and Marcos barricaded in his palace, the Philippine leader telephoned Laxalt and asked, &ldquo;Should I step down? Senator, what do you think?&rdquo; Laxalt said he replied: &ldquo;Mr. President, I am not bound by diplomatic restraints. I am talking only for myself. I think you should cut and cut cleanly. I think the time has come.&rdquo; Such a comment from the president&rsquo;s close friend showed the United States had withdrawn support for Marcos, and he resigned. Laxalt won praise from conservatives in 1978 when he led an unsuccessful fight against Senate approval of Democratic President Jimmy Carter&rsquo;s treaty under which the United States ceded the Panama Canal to Panama. Laxalt ran unsuccessfully for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination to succeed Reagan. He then worked as a lawyer and consultant in Washington. Laxalt served for years in the Senate with fellow Republican Pete Domenici and in February 2013, Domenici admitted to having fathered a child more than three decades earlier with Laxalt&rsquo;s daughter, Michelle. Laxalt was born in Reno on Aug. 2, 1922, and grew up in Carson City. In his memoir, he said he absorbed politics through conversations with prominent Nevadans while working in his mother&rsquo;s French restaurant in the state capital. He served as a U.S. Army medic during World War Two and afterward practiced law in Carson City. He became Nevada&rsquo;s lieutenant governor in 1963 and governor four years later. Laxalt was instrumental in creating the modern Las Vegas casino and tourism industry, championing measures while governor to let corporations hold gaming licenses. The federal government at the time was eager to close the Las Vegas Strip hotels that the FBI and others suspected were controlled by organized crime. Laxalt settled a suit against the Sacramento Bee newspaper over an article alleging that a Nevada hotel casino he owned engaged in illegal skimming of profits. Although not personally accused of wrongdoing, he pressed a $250 million libel suit, arguing he was defamed by association. The suit was dropped in 1987 and his attorneys were awarded $650,000 to be paid by the newspaper. Laxalt married his second wife, Carol Wilson, in 1976. He has five daughters and one son with his first wife. He was the older brother of Robert Laxalt, author of &ldquo;Sweet Promised Land&rdquo; (1957) and other books.

Mahathir swiftly reopened an investigation into 1MDB and barred Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor from leaving the country. Last month, Najib was arrested and charged with abuse of power and criminal breach of trust related to an alleged transfer of 42 million ringgit ($10.31 million) into his personal bank account from SRC International, a former unit of state fund 1MDB. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released after posting bail. He is expected to attend a pre-trial hearing in court on Wednesday. Najib arrived at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) office at 5 p.m. (0900 GMT) in a four-car motorcade. He was in the building for about 45 minutes after which his motorcade was seen leaving the premises. MACC and Najib&rsquo;s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.  1MDB is being investigated by at least six countries, including Singapore, Switzerland and the United States, over alleged money laundering and graft. The U.S. Department of Justice says an estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates.

Najib, 65, and his family have faced intense scrutiny since May when a shock election result brought his former mentor-turned-foe, 92-year-old Mahathir Mohamad, back to power. Mahathir swiftly reopened an investigation into 1MDB and barred Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor from leaving the country. Last month, Najib was arrested and charged with abuse of power and criminal breach of trust related to an alleged transfer of 42 million ringgit ($10.31 million) into his personal bank account from SRC International, a former unit of state fund 1MDB. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released after posting bail. He is expected to attend a pre-trial hearing in court on Wednesday. Najib arrived at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) office at 5 p.m. (0900 GMT) in a four-car motorcade. He was in the building for about 45 minutes after which his motorcade was seen leaving the premises. MACC and Najib&rsquo;s spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.  1MDB is being investigated by at least six countries, including Singapore, Switzerland and the United States, over alleged money laundering and graft. The U.S. Department of Justice says an estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates.

Europe&rsquo;s biggest economy saw vacancies surge by 25,000 on the quarter and 115,000 on the year to reach 1.21 million in the April-June period, a survey by the IAB labor office research institute found. Asked for the main reasons that are complicating recruitment, most employers pointed to a shortage of applicants and insufficient job qualifications. Separate data on Tuesday from the Economy Ministry showed industrial output rose 0.4 percent on the quarter in the April-June period despite a weaker-than-expected reading for June. That release followed data on Monday that showed German industrial orders dropped in June by the most in nearly 1-1\/2 years, suggesting that trade tensions caused by U.S. President Donald Trump could limit growth. &ldquo;June&rsquo;s industrial production and trade figures suggest that the previously booming German economy is already feeling the effects of trade tensions,&rdquo; said Jennifer McKeown at London-based Capital Economics. &ldquo;But with the domestic economy in good shape and given the recent ceasefire in the tariff war, we expect only a modest slowdown in German growth.&rdquo; In June alone, industrial output fell 0.9 percent, missing a Reuters forecast for a drop on the month of 0.5 percent. That came after a downwardly revised rise of 2.4 percent in May. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not a great result, but it could have been worse,&rdquo; Bankhaus Lampe economist Alexander Krueger said. &ldquo;In contrast to the first quarter, industrial production supported growth in the second quarter.&rdquo; GROWTH EXPECTED The Federal Statistics Office will publish preliminary gross domestic product growth data for the second quarter next Tuesday. Analysts polled by Reuters on average expect the quarterly growth rate to edge up to 0.4 percent from 0.3 percent in January-March, driven by private consumption and construction. The German economy expanded by a robust 2.5 percent in 2017 and most analysts expect only a moderate slowdown to around 2 percent this year. The Federal Statistics Office said in a separate statement that seasonally adjusted exports were unchanged on the month in June while imports rose by 1.2 percent. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus narrowed to 19.3 billion euros from an upwardly revised 20.4 billion euros  ($23.60 billion) in May. Trump has agreed to refrain from imposing tariffs on cars imported from the EU while the two sides negotiate to cut other trade barriers. The decision, reached in talks between Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Washington last month, eased fears of a transatlantic trade war.

The Ohio race for a U.S. House of Representatives seat headlines a day of voting across the country that also features primaries in four other states. Other key contests include a Democratic battle for governor in Michigan between a progressive and a mainstream candidate and a high-profile conservative challenge to the incumbent Republican governor in Kansas. Trump charged into the Ohio race, the final special election before November. He visited the reliably Republican 12th Congressional District over the weekend to try to head off an upset after polls showed a tightening battle between Republican Troy Balderson and Democrat Danny O&rsquo;Connor. The district, split between suburban Columbus and rural areas, has been represented by a Republican since the early 1980s. Trump carried it by 11 percentage points in the 2016 presidential race. But O&rsquo;Connor has wiped out most or all of Balderson&rsquo;s lead in polls, and a Democratic win would set off alarm bells for Republicans already worried by a series of strong performances in special elections by Democrats in the Trump era. &ldquo;A month ago this race was flying under the radar, but it has become nationalized and become more of a referendum on Trump, which really generates Democratic enthusiasm,&rdquo; said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. A Monmouth poll last week showed the race was essentially a dead heat, down from a double-digit advantage for Balderson a month ago. In addition to more Democrats expressing high interest in the race, Murray said the shift was driven by independents unhappy with the status quo under Trump. As voters prepared to visit the polls on Tuesday, Trump again pushed Balderson in an early morning tweet. Democrats must pick up 23 seats in the House and two seats in the U.S. Senate to gain control of those chambers and put a brake on Trump&rsquo;s agenda. All 435 House seats, 35 of 100 Senate seats and 36 of 50 governors&rsquo; offices are up for grabs in the Nov. 6 midterms. Other well-known Republicans also trekked to Ohio, including Vice President Mike Pence. A Republican advocacy group aired an ad featuring praise for Balderson, a state lawmaker, from Ohio Governor John Kasich, a frequent critic of Trump. Republicans have tried to paint O&rsquo;Connor, a local county official, as a liberal who would follow House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. But O&rsquo;Connor has walked a more moderate line, saying he wants new party leadership in Congress and would work with Republicans, while also criticizing the Trump tax cut. Michigan, Missouri, Kansas and Washington also hold primaries on Tuesday. The Democratic race for governor in Michigan offers the next test of the electoral power of the party&rsquo;s progressive wing, with health director Abdul El-Sayed vying to become the country&rsquo;s first Muslim governor against a more moderate Democrat, former state Senate leader Gretchen Whitmer. El-Sayed was endorsed by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and campaigned recently with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young democratic socialist whose shocking New York primary upset in June made her a movement star. In Kansas, prominent conservative Kris Kobach, a national leader in the movement to restrict illegal immigration and pass more restrictive voting laws, is challenging Governor Jeff Colyer for the Republican gubernatorial nomination on Tuesday. Trump endorsed Kobach, Kansas&rsquo; secretary of state, on Monday. Kobach was an immigration adviser to Trump&rsquo;s campaign in 2016 and was vice chairman of Trump&rsquo;s commission to investigate voting fraud before the panel collapsed.

Following are comments and responses from companies in Europe which last year did far more business with Tehran than U.S. firms did: DAIMLER (DAIGn.DE )  German car and truck manufacturer Daimler has dropped plans to expand its Iran business. &ldquo;We have ceased our already restricted activities in Iran in accordance with the applicable sanctions&rdquo;, Daimler said. In early 2016, Daimler established a joint venture with vehicle manufacturer and dealer Iran Khodro Co to make and distribute Mercedes-Benz trucks in the country. PSA (PEUP.PA ) and RENAULT (RENA.PA ) Peugeot manufacturer PSA began taking steps in June to suspend its joint venture activities in Iran while rival Renault has said it will adhere to the U.S. sanctions regime.  Both had until Aug 6 to wind down their operations. A Renault spokesman said the company had no comment to make beyond what Chief Operating Officer Thierry Bollore said in July, when he told analysts:  &ldquo;As we comply fully with U.S. sanctions, it&rsquo;s likely that our development would be put on hold.&rdquo;  After the nuclear accord was agreed in 2015 both PSA and Renault moved swiftly to sign new production deals to upgrade their pre-sanctions partnerships in Iran.  PSA signed production deals worth 700 million euros, while Renault announced a new plant investment to increase production capacity to 350,000 vehicles a year. TOTAL (TOTF.PA ) Total has said it will quit the multibillion-dollar South Pars gas project if it cannot secure a waiver from the U.S. sanctions \u2013 a request French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said last month had been rejected along with others by French corporations. [nL5N1SN5HZ ] Total signed a contract in 2017 to develop Phase II of the South Pars field with an initial investment of $1 billion and has not yet said what it will do with its 30 percent stake should it pull out. It has until Nov 4 to wind down its Iran operations, barring any surprise exemption. ATR (AIR.PA ) (LDOF.MI ) Turboprop aircraft maker ATR on Aug 6 confirmed it had delivered five more planes to IranAir shortly before Washington imposed new sanctions but still faces difficulties obtaining U.S. permission to hand over another seven on order. SANOFI (SASY.PA ) Drugmaker Sanofi said it was premature to say if there will be any impact on its operations in Iran. Sanofi announced in early 2016 that it had signed an MoU with Tehran aimed at bolstering its presence in Iran. Medicines were exempted from the original nuclear sanctions although shipping drugs into the country was difficult. ROCHE (ROG.S )  &ldquo;We will continue to monitor the situation closely, assess the impact of the recently reintroduced economic sanctions and continue to work to ensure that patients in Iran can be provided with our innovative medicines, diagnostics and diabetes products,&rdquo; the Swiss drugs company said. NESTLE (NESN.S )  Nestle sees no direct fallout from renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. Nestle Iran has its headquarters in Tehran and two factories: one in Qazvin that produces infant cereals and infant formula, and a bottled water factory in Polour.  The company has 818 employees and imports a limited range of Nestle products from abroad, it said.

It was the second tax hike on textiles in as many months after an increase on other products including fiber and apparels last month. The moves are expected to provide relief to the domestic textile industry, which has been hit by cheaper imports. India&rsquo;s total textile imports jumped by 16 percent to a record $7 billion in the fiscal year to March 2018. Of this, about $3 billion were from China. The government did not disclose details of the 328 textile products that will be subject to the duty increase announced on Tuesday. Rising imports sent India&rsquo;s trade deficit with China in textile products to a record high $1.54 billion in 2017\/18, alarming industry officials as India had been until recently a net exporter of textile products to China. Sanjay Jain, president of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, told Reuters he did not expect China to retaliate to the Indian duty increases as it still has a trade surplus with India. He said India&rsquo;s textile product imports could fall to $6 billion in 2018\/19 as a result of the tax hike to 20 percent. India&rsquo;s imports of textile products from Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia also jumped in the last few years as they are not subject to any duty under free trade agreements (FTA) signed by India with these countries. The 20 percent duty will not be applicable to products sourced from those countries due to the FTA, Jain said. Industry officials say in the last few months Chinese fiber has been shipped to Bangladesh and processed and exported to India with zero duty. &ldquo;Rules of origin need to be implemented for textile products.

Jain said India&rsquo;s textile and garment exports could rise 8 percent to $40 billion in 2018\/19 due to a weak rupee and as the government is expected to introduce incentives to boost overseas sales. India&rsquo;s trade differences with the United States have also been rising since President Donald Trump took office. India, the world&rsquo;s biggest buyer of U.S. almonds, in June decided to raise import duties on almonds and some other U.S. imports by 20 percent, joining the European Union and China in retaliating against Trump&rsquo;s tariff hikes on steel and aluminum. The increased tariff on U.S. goods will be applicable from Sept. 18.

Following are comments and responses from companies in Europe which last year did far more business with Tehran than U.S. firms did: DAIMLER (DAIGn.DE )  German car and truck manufacturer Daimler has dropped plans to expand its Iran business. &ldquo;We have ceased our already restricted activities in Iran in accordance with the applicable sanctions&rdquo;, Daimler said. In early 2016, Daimler established a joint venture with vehicle manufacturer and dealer Iran Khodro Co to make and distribute Mercedes-Benz trucks in the country. PSA (PEUP.PA ) and RENAULT (RENA.PA ) Peugeot manufacturer PSA began taking steps in June to suspend its joint venture activities in Iran while rival Renault has said it will adhere to the U.S. sanctions regime.  Both had until Aug 6 to wind down their operations. A Renault spokesman said the company had no comment to make beyond what Chief Operating Officer Thierry Bollore said in July, when he told analysts:  &ldquo;As we comply fully with U.S. sanctions, it&rsquo;s likely that our development would be put on hold.&rdquo;  After the nuclear accord was agreed in 2015 both PSA and Renault moved swiftly to sign new production deals to upgrade their pre-sanctions partnerships in Iran.  PSA signed production deals worth 700 million euros, while Renault announced a new plant investment to increase production capacity to 350,000 vehicles a year. TOTAL (TOTF.PA ) Total has said it will quit the multibillion-dollar South Pars gas project if it cannot secure a waiver from the U.S. sanctions \u2013 a request French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said last month had been rejected along with others by French corporations. [nL5N1SN5HZ ] Total signed a contract in 2017 to develop Phase II of the South Pars field with an initial investment of $1 billion and has not yet said what it will do with its 30 percent stake should it pull out. It has until Nov 4 to wind down its Iran operations, barring any surprise exemption. ATR (AIR.PA ) (LDOF.MI ) Turboprop aircraft maker ATR on Aug 6 confirmed it had delivered five more planes to IranAir shortly before Washington imposed new sanctions but still faces difficulties obtaining U.S. permission to hand over another seven on order. SANOFI (SASY.PA ) Drugmaker Sanofi said it was premature to say if there will be any impact on its operations in Iran. Sanofi announced in early 2016 that it had signed an MoU with Tehran aimed at bolstering its presence in Iran. Medicines were exempted from the original nuclear sanctions although shipping drugs into the country was difficult. ROCHE (ROG.S )  &ldquo;We will continue to monitor the situation closely, assess the impact of the recently reintroduced economic sanctions and continue to work to ensure that patients in Iran can be provided with our innovative medicines, diagnostics and diabetes products,&rdquo; the Swiss drugs company said. NESTLE (NESN.S )  Nestle sees no direct fallout from renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran. Nestle Iran has its headquarters in Tehran and two factories: one in Qazvin that produces infant cereals and infant formula, and a bottled water factory in Polour.  The company has 818 employees and imports a limited range of Nestle products from abroad, it said.

He was less than 50 meters (yards) from the embassy on Aug. 7, 1998 when a truck bomb detonated, transforming the normally bustling business district into a war zone.  It was Osama bin Laden&rsquo;s announcement to the world that his al Qaeda was a global threat: a coordinated bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and neighboring Tanzania.  The two bombings killed 258 people, the majority in Nairobi. Three years later, al Qaeda would conduct its most notorious attack, flying passenger planes into New York&rsquo;s World Trade Center and the Pentagon, killing some 3,000 people. Mwadama does not remember who pulled him out of the rubble, bleeding from a gash in his neck caused by a flying shard of glass. He recalls hearing screams and ambulance sirens. People in bloodsoaked clothing were carried on makeshift stretchers past what was left of the embassy.  He lost two friends that day, his livelihood as a voiceover artist and public speaker, and the cheque he was going to cash, earned for voicing a Coca-Cola ad aired during the 1998 soccer World Cup.  Ali Mwadama, a survivor of the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing, looks for the names of his friends on the August 7th memorial wall in Nairobi, Kenya, August 5, 2018.

Other scars run deeper.  &ldquo;Wherever I go, wherever I sit, I am so afraid of anything that could attack me,&rdquo; he told Reuters, holding a photograph taken of him after the attack. In it, he stares blankly at a wall, a bloody bandage covering his 26 stitches, his three children watching with concerned expressions. THUNDEROUS BANG Civil servant Julie Ogoye was talking to a colleague in their fourth floor Nairobi office when she heard a strange noise outside. &ldquo;I think I only went two steps, then I heard a very loud thunderous bang,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And what I saw was a silverish white cloud moving up.&rdquo; That was the last thing she saw in a long time.

Ogoye got up, helped by a colleague, and stumbled in blindness over debris and what she later learned were dead bodies. &ldquo;When I lifted my hand and put it on the socket, I noticed it was an empty socket. My eyeball was hanging at the nose area,&rdquo; she recalled. The shock made her pass out. Her sight partially returned in her right eye. The left socket was filled with a prosthesis. Ogoye is not eager to forget.  At the weekend, she visited the former site of the embassy, now the August 7th Memorial Park. &ldquo;This park. It was rubble and blood and a stinking place, but they have transformed it into a beautiful place,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;To me it is symbolic.

It was the second tax hike on textiles in as many months after an increase on other products including fiber and apparels last month. The moves are expected to provide relief to the domestic textile industry, which has been hit by cheaper imports. India&rsquo;s total textile imports jumped by 16 percent to a record $7 billion in the fiscal year to March 2018. Of this, about $3 billion were from China. The government did not disclose details of the 328 textile products that will be subject to the duty increase announced on Tuesday. Rising imports sent India&rsquo;s trade deficit with China in textile products to a record high $1.54 billion in 2017\/18, alarming industry officials as India had been until recently a net exporter of textile products to China. Sanjay Jain, president of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, told Reuters he did not expect China to retaliate to the Indian duty increases as it still has a trade surplus with India. He said India&rsquo;s textile product imports could fall to $6 billion in 2018\/19 as a result of the tax hike to 20 percent. India&rsquo;s imports of textile products from Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia also jumped in the last few years as they are not subject to any duty under free trade agreements (FTA) signed by India with these countries. The 20 percent duty will not be applicable to products sourced from those countries due to the FTA, Jain said. Industry officials say in the last few months Chinese fiber has been shipped to Bangladesh and processed and exported to India with zero duty. &ldquo;Rules of origin need to be implemented for textile products. Otherwise Chinese products will land from other countries,&rdquo; said a Mumbai-based garment exporter, who declined to be named.

But their fears of an offensive are growing. The village is situated in rebel-held territory near the frontline with government forces in the northwestern Idlib region, one of the last big strongholds of the opposition to President Bashar al-Assad. The seven-year-long conflict may be about to pivot again to the northwest now that Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, has crushed the rebellion across much of the rest of the country. Assad has indicated Idlib could be his next target. The entire population of al-Surman fled the village in January during the last big government attack in the area.   Some came back when the bombardment stopped. But most only returned once the Turks arrived to set up an observation post at its grain silos under an agreement between Turkey, Russia and Iran. &ldquo;Protection comes firstly from God, and after that it&rsquo;s up to the Turks,&rdquo; said Mohammad al-Youssef, 33, a resident of the village 40 km (25 miles) southeast of Idlib city. Still, he says the Turkish presence offers only partial reassurance. &ldquo;There is constant worry because there are no promises the regime won&rsquo;t advance,&rdquo; he said.     A boy stands on woven mats in Idlib province, Syria July 29, 2018. REUTERS\/ Khalil Ashawi Displaced Syrians have poured into Idlib from other parts of the country recovered by Assad. The possibility of an Idlib offensive has drawn warnings of yet another humanitarian catastrophe in a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and driven 11 million from their homes. The United Nations has warned that up to 2.5 million people could flee toward the Turkish border in such a scenario. This possibility is sounding alarm bells in Turkey, which is already hosting 3.5 million Syrian refugees and fears a government offensive would drive yet more over its border. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is pressing his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin over the issue, and has said Turkey - with NATO&rsquo;s second-biggest army - cannot accept an offensive in Idlib. HOPING FOR MORE TURKISH FORCES Near al-Surman, thousands of people uprooted by the January offensive are still living in tents in olive and fig groves. The local economy has ground to a halt in anticipation of an offensive. Factories known for the production of woven plastic mats have shut down and home repairs are being postponed. &ldquo;People are saying we will keep our money for the days to come, in case we are displaced,&rdquo; Youssef said.     Turkish forces have deployed at 12 observation posts in the Idlib region under the agreement reached with Russia and Iran in the Kazakh capital of Astana. Under this agreement, Idlib is considered a &ldquo;de-escalation&rdquo; zone. Slideshow (8 Images)  Erdogan has said the Astana accord could be destroyed if the government attacks.      The people in al-Surman are aware that their fate may hinge on international diplomacy. It gives them little comfort. &ldquo;We are awaiting conferences in the coming weeks to know Idlib&rsquo;s fate,&rdquo; said Khaled Daimes, 33, a factory owner. &ldquo;We can only feel at ease when the guarantees come from the Turks,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I hope to see the Turks in the village square.&rdquo; He wants to see Turkish forces deploy into Idlib in the same kind of numbers they have sent into areas north of Aleppo. There, Turkey has carved out a de facto buffer zone outside any stated agreements with Russia or Iran. Assad views the Turks as illegal occupiers and has vowed to recover &ldquo;every inch&rdquo; of Syria. Russia&rsquo;s priorities, particularly its relationship with Turkey, are key to determining Idlib&rsquo;s fate, analysts say. Rebel commanders believe an offensive inevitable. This assessment has been hardened by the recent campaign in the southwestern region near Israel and Jordan, recovered by the government in a Russian-backed assault in a matter of weeks. That region had also been declared a de-escalation zone in an agreement between the United States and Russia. The commander of the rebel group Ahrar al-Sharqia said he was 90 percent certain that the government would attack Idlib once its offensive in the southwest is finished. &ldquo;We are working to prepare our fighters,&rdquo; the commander, Abu Hatem Shaqra, said. Asked whether Turkey would stand by rebels in the event of an attack, he said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t answer this question clearly. On one level, the Turkish brothers have many statements that Idlib is a red line. But on the ground nothing is clear.&rdquo; "},"2c7e2c0c38498f2780c3ef553c0febc2":{"title":"Tribal chiefs face reckoning over rights to South Africa&#x27;s rural homelands","text":"MORULENG, South Africa (Reuters) - A hardscrabble patch of South Africa disputed between black farmers and tribal leaders working with platinum mining interests is legal ground zero in a battle to loosen the chiefs&rsquo; grip on communal lands.  Land rights are a hot-button issue ahead of elections in 2019 as the African National Congress (ANC) moves forward with a constitutional amendment aimed at a more equitable distribution of land, including possibly expropriating land from whites without compensation. That prospect, evoking the chaotic land grabs that wrecked the economy of neighboring Zimbabwe, has grabbed headlines and alarmed investors despite repeated pledges by President Cyril Ramaphosa that things will be different in South Africa. A related issue is also sensitive for the ANC, however: the plight of poor blacks vulnerable to forced evictions in tribal lands because of a system of property rights that dates back to the colonial era, before apartheid. The &ldquo;Homelands&rdquo; make up only 13 percent of the land but are home to a third of the population, 17 million blacks, mostly subsistence farmers working tiny plots.\u00a0Tribal councils control these areas, often determining who gets to farm or where cattle is grazed but also access to resources like water and minerals. Transferring that control to those who occupy or work the land would have major repercussions both for companies who have been negotiating mining rights with the tribal chiefs for decades and for politicians who count on the chiefs to deliver the local vote. &ldquo;The implication is that such communities should be the negotiating body rather than traditional councils,&rdquo; said Johan Lorenzen, a lawyer at leading human rights firm Richard Spoor Inc Attorneys. &ldquo;That would create significant legal risk for all the deals already struck with traditional councils,&rdquo; Lorenzen said.  It may be an idea whose time has come, as protests spread and support for the ANC steadily declines in tribal areas. At issue in the case before the Constitutional Court is a deal agreed with the council of the Bakgatla tribe to allow Pilanesberg Platinum Mines (PPM) to evict farmers in order to expand its open-pit mine onto tribal land.  Activist David Pheto, one of the claimants, told Reuters the community was not fighting mining, but forcible evictions. &ldquo;If mining must take place we need consultation and consent because we are the owners,&rdquo; he said. The court is expected to rule on the case late this year.

The elderly Grace Maledu, the lead claimant, and her neighbors say their families pooled their money to buy several hundred hectares in the area a century ago but did not get a title deed because of laws that restricted black property ownership.  Instead, the farm was registered with a white government official who held it on behalf of the tribal chief, according to court papers filed on the farmers&rsquo; behalf by the law firm Lawyers for Human Rights. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&ldquo;We planted maize there, but it has been chopped up for the mine,&rdquo; said an agitated Maledu, pointing beyond a steel-ringed fence to the mine where massive trucks threw up clouds of dust. PPM, a unit of unlisted Sedibelo Platinum Mines, declined to comment on the case until after the court rules. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But in court filings, PPM and a partner company formed by the tribal council take the position that the Bakgatla community controls the farm and adjoining properties communally, with the chief as custodian.  The company says 24 people have already relocated voluntarily, with 25,000 rand ($1,875) to each and their huts moved to nearby farms.  The case also tests whether the deal with the tribal council trumps a 1996 law - passed during Nelson Mandela&rsquo;s presidency - protecting people on communal land. &ldquo;This case could be the game changer,&rdquo; said Aninka Claassens, director of the University of Cape Town&rsquo;s Land and Accountability Research Centre.  &ldquo;If they had obtained a title deed then they would be in a similar position to white owners who require a mining company to sign leases with them,&rdquo; she said.  Companies like Anglo American Platinum and Impala Platinum may find they are ahead of the curve, having renegotiated tribal deals with wider participation and transparency after significant losses from protests. Impala Platinum&rsquo;s Marula mine lost 10,000 of almost 80,000 ounces of production to protests that included road blocks and assaults on vehicles and people going to work. Falling platinum prices have added to the pressure. Amplats says it has secured peace around its Mogalakwena operation, the world&rsquo;s largest open-pit platinum mine and the Anglo American unit&rsquo;s main cash spinner. &ldquo;You can never underestimate the expectations around communities and the need around communities,&rdquo; Amplats&rsquo; Chief Executive Chris Griffith told Reuters. Slideshow (3 Images)  ANOTHER WAR?  The tribal authorities are generally seen as an important political base of the ANC, cultivated especially by former president Jacob Zuma, a traditional Zulu. The chiefs warned the ANC in July it risked conflict if it included the homelands in its land reform drive. In a speech to supporters, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini even evoked the 19th century Anglo-Zulu war. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &ldquo;What I want you to know about our history is that the issue we are faced with now is very similar to the one our forefathers were faced with,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This will be the second clash.&rdquo; In a hastily arranged meeting afterwards, Ramaphosa assured Zwelithini that the 28,000 sq km (10,810 sq miles) under his control would not be touched. Former president Kgalema Motlanthe, who chaired a panel on land reform, has accused the chiefs of acting like &ldquo;village tin-pot dictators&rdquo;. Senior ANC officials say the party is determined to make a change in the homelands, including rolling out deeds to residents, partly because the chiefs are not delivering the vote.  Election results in rural areas in North West province which includes the Bakgatla community and in Limpopo province where mining deals have fueled unrest show the ANC is losing support. Backing for the ANC in these areas in 2011 ranged from 75 to 84 percent, according to official data. Nationally the party bagged 63 percent in 2011, falling to 54.5 percent in 2016. In 2016, its support in Mabideng, where the Bakgatla live, fell to 54 percent from 75 percent in 2011. In Mogalakwena, on the restive northern limb of the platinum belt, it dropped to 64 percent from 84 percent over the same period. &ldquo;If you put these voting patterns together with evidence showing people are angry with the way chiefs use their land powers, there is a clear pattern,&rdquo; said Steven Friedman, a professor and political analyst at the University of Johannesburg. Zolani Mkiva, General Secretary of Contralesa, the umbrella group for the traditional leaders, says homeland residents risk falling into a debt trap if they own property.  &ldquo;People will use it as collateral to access finance. And then what happens? People will have to cede land back to the finance institutions,&rdquo; he said. Economists argue that it is precisely this state of affairs that traps people in poverty and leaves them vulnerable to eviction, however. Critics of the ANC&rsquo;s land reform policy say that instead of seizing land from whites, the party should focus on reform in the homelands, which could turn millions into property owners virtually overnight. &ldquo;The government a century ago prevented us from having title deeds,&rdquo; said Pheto, the activist. &ldquo;To get the same treatment from our own government, it&rsquo;s a disgrace. The chiefs are not the owners of the land.&rdquo; "},"c75ece203a58bd0176ff7e71aec1441b":{"title":"Bolton says North Korea has not lived up to denuclearization deal: Fox","text":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House national security adviser John Bolton on Tuesday said North Korea has not taken the steps necessary to denuclearize despite an agreement made between Pyongyang&rsquo;s leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in June.

Investigators said they had opened a criminal case against the two editors from the privately owned independent news website  &ldquo;Tut.by&rdquo; and one journalist from the independent news agency BelaPAN. Local rights groups said arrests were part of a government drive to muzzle independent media. Last year the Belarus authorities put down peaceful opposition protests in a severe  crackdown which ended a brief period during which the government had eased its authoritarian rule.  &ldquo;Without the knowledge or agreement of the republican  unitary enterprise (BelTA), information held on its computer system was accessed illegally more than 15,000 times over a two-year period,&rdquo; investigators said in a statement. Andrei Bastunets, head of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, said government pressure on independent media had been on the rise in the last year. &ldquo;I link this (case) with the general trend and the desire to control the internet space,&rdquo; he said. Ales Belyatsky, from human rights organization Viasna-96, agreed: &ldquo;This is a purposeful policy of limiting the information field in Belarus,&rdquo; he was cited as saying on the website palitviazni.info. Investigators searched the Minsk offices of Tut.by and BelaPAN on Tuesday morning. The punishment for such a charge is either a fine r a jail term of up to two years. Nasha niva, another independent news website, cited a representative of BelTA as saying that the detained journalists had used other people&rsquo;s passwords to access its news wire.         President Alexander Lukashenko has run Belarus along Soviet-style command lines since 1994. He has heeded some calls from the West to show more leniency toward political opposition, but opponents say their freedom to operate remains severely limited. Representatives of the BelaPAN news agency were not immediately available for comment and its web site stopped updating. Tut.by is the biggest online news portal in the country with 800,000 daily unique users.

On Monday, the currency fell as much as 5.5 percent to 5.4250 against the dollar, an all-time low and its biggest intraday drop in nearly a decade, after Washington said it was reviewing access to the U.S. market for Turkey&rsquo;s exports. It was trading at 5.3035 to the dollar TRYTOM=D3 at 1201 GMT (8.01 a.m. ET) and at 6.1535 per euro EURTRY. Turkey's 10-year benchmark bond yield hit 20.09 percent, the highest on record. The depth of the sell-off reflects growing unease about the direction of monetary policy under Erdogan, a self-described &ldquo;enemy of interest rates&rdquo;, and the impact of worsening ties with the United States, a NATO ally and major trading partner. The lira&rsquo;s chronic weakness \u2014 it is down 27 percent on the dollar and 26 percent against the euro year-to-date \u2014 has driven inflation to nearly 16 percent and fueled expectations that an emergency rate hike may be needed to prop it up.  &ldquo;The plunge in the currency over the past few weeks is now on a scale which has, in the past, prompted the central bank to hike interest rates aggressively,&rdquo; William Jackson of Capital Economics said in a note to clients. &ldquo;The lira&rsquo;s fall is being amplified by concerns that the central bank will not act to shore up the currency.&rdquo;  The central bank raised interest rates to support the lira in an emergency move in May, before a re-elected Erdogan assumed new executive powers that investors fear will compromise its independence. The president wants lower borrowing costs to fuel credit growth and economic expansion. Economists say the economy is overheated and needs higher rates. The central bank&rsquo;s apparent reluctance to hike has heightened concerns about its ability to act independently of Erdogan, who appointed his son-in-law Berat Albayrak as treasury and finance minister last month.    U.S ROW The row with the United States has only served to further undermine sentiment among foreign investors, upon whom Turkey relies to fund its widening current account deficit.  Broadcaster CNN Turk reported overnight, citing diplomatic sources, that a Turkish delegation will head to Washington in two days to discuss the row between the NATO allies. Relations have been strained by differences over Syria, and the trial in Turkey of U.S. evangelical Christian pastor Andrew Brunson for allegedly supporting the group Ankara blames for an attempted coup in 2016. Brunson denies the charge.  Over the weekend, the U.S. Trade Representative said the United States was reviewing Turkey&rsquo;s duty-free access to its markets, after Ankara imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to American tariffs on steel and aluminum. The move could affect $1.7 billion of Turkish exports. The spat has further hammered the lira, which lost nearly a quarter of its value last year, even after a cut to the upper limit of banks&rsquo; reserve requirements that the central bank said on Monday would provide lenders with $2.2 billion of liquidity. &ldquo;In an environment where the market expects an interest rate hike, the central bank only changed reserve requirements,&rdquo; said economist Mahfi Egilmez on Twitter. &ldquo;The lira plunged as markets got the impression that the central bank has problems hiking rates. It would have been better if they did not change the reserve requirements at all.&rdquo; NO HEADLINES Erdogan, who has previously cast lira selling as the work of Western financiers attempting to bring Turkey to its knees, has been notably quiet about the crisis this time around. Last week, he called on Turks to convert hard currency and gold into lira and said Turkey would turn to Chinese markets for financing. Local media made little mention of the currency crisis on Tuesday, with almost none of more than 20 mainstream newspapers mentioning the sell-off. It made headlines of some opposition newspapers and the main business paper.  The lira&rsquo;s plunge has sharpened investor concern about the outlook for Turkish companies. They have for years borrowed in hard currency, drawn by lower interest rates, but the lira crisis has made it more expensive to repay that debt. Credit ratings agency Moody&rsquo;s has predicted problem loans will rise to well above 4 percent in the next 12-18 months, from 2.9 percent from May, which would also be costly for banks. Goldman Sachs meanwhile warned that a further drop in the lira could wipe out Turkish banks&rsquo; capital buffers. As of May, Turkish companies had $222.8 billion in long-term loans from abroad, almost all in dollars or euros, central bank data shows. Turkish stocks were up half a percent. The BIST index of blue-chip stocks  is down 40 percent in dollar terms this year, according to Thomson Reuters data \u2014 second only to Venezuela as the worst performer among some 30 emerging market stock indices.

Coming at a crucial time for Arsenal as they start life without manager Arsene Wenger for the first time in 22 years, the deal cements the position of the U.S. sports boss among an elite band of super-rich soccer club owners in England.  Fans worry however that Kroenke, relying on a loan for the bulk of the funding, will not spend enough to compete for players with the likes of Chelsea, Manchester City or Paris St Germain, backed by money from Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar respectively.   The deal ends a standoff between the two tycoons, who had both battled for control, but it has angered the small group of well-connected independent shareholders who see themselves as guardians of the 132-year-old club. &ldquo;The Arsenal Supporters&rsquo; Trust is wholly against this takeover,&rdquo; one fans&rsquo; group said. &ldquo;Arsenal remains too important to be owned by any one person.&rdquo; Kroenke, who largely avoids the media spotlight, owns a string of U.S. sports clubs including the U.S. Denver Nuggets basketball team, the Los Angeles Rams American Football team and the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer. DONE DEAL Initially viewed with suspicion by the Arsenal board, the 71-year-old started building his stake in 2007 as he slowly bought out the families who had run the club for generations.       He said on Tuesday he had now received an acceptance from Usmanov to buy his 30 percent stake, adding to the 67 percent he already owns. He will now buy out the remaining independent shareholders at 29,000 pounds for each of its rarely traded  shares - more than the average salary for a British worker. &ldquo;We appreciate Mr Usmanov&rsquo;s dedication to the Arsenal Football Club and the storied ethos and history the club represents,&rdquo; he said.  Usmanov, ranked by Forbes as Russia&rsquo;s 10th richest man with a fortune of $12.5 billion, owns stakes in some of Russia&rsquo;s biggest companies including phone operator Megafon, iron ore producer Metalloinvest and Internet group Mail.ru.  &ldquo;\u200bI have decided to sell my shares in Arsenal Football Club which could be the best football club in the world,&rdquo; Usmanov said in a brief statement. To buy him and the other investors out, Kroenke will pay 602 million pounds, using 45 million pounds of his own money and a 557 million pound loan from Deutsche Bank.  FAN FEARS In a world where clubs are owned by billionaires who do not always turn up to watch them play, the independent shareholders formed a rare bridge between the club&rsquo;s board and its fans.  Arsenal&rsquo;s annual meeting was always a feisty affair. At the last game of last season, when Wenger stood down, some fans hired a plane with a banner saying &ldquo;Kroenke - You&rsquo;re next&rdquo;.   David Kershaw, an independent shareholder, fan and CEO of advertising group M&C Saatchi, said he was concerned that the deal would not lead to a better performance on the pitch.  &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s very sad that we&rsquo;re in danger of losing any transparency into how our club is run,&rdquo; he told Reuters. His comments were echoed by Patrick Barnes, a shareholder who has been going to Arsenal since the 1970s to watch the likes of Liam Brady, Tony Adams, Dennis Bergkamp and Thierry Henry.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed it&rsquo;s come to this, it was a strong way to connect to the club when you owned a piece of it,&rdquo; he said.  Kroenke now competes against the billionaire owners of other clubs such as Chelsea&rsquo;s Roman Abramovich, Manchester United&rsquo;s Glazer family and Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahayan, who owns last season&rsquo;s runaway winners, Manchester City.       Arsenal fans have long complained that the club has not plowed enough money into the team. Americans have had a mixed fortune as Premier League owners, with the Glazer family rarely popular at Manchester United, even when the club won the league.  Arsenal finished the 2017\/18 season in sixth place behind the two Manchester clubs, fierce local rivals Tottenham Hostpur, Liverpool and Chelsea. That marked the second season running it had missed out on the lucrative European Champions League.   Founded by workers at the Royal Arsenal armaments factory, the Arsenal team have claimed the League 13 times, including three under Wenger, and are FA Cup winners a record 13 times. New manager Unai Emery, who joined from Paris St Germain, will be given a baptism of fire this weekend when Arsenal kick off their new season against Manchester City.

"},"b608d315a1a5af31bd896e0b35ae77cc":{"title":"No-deal Brexit? What it might mean for Britain","text":"LONDON\/GENEVA (Reuters) - The prospect of a &ldquo;no-deal Brexit&rdquo; appears to have grown after the European Union&rsquo;s negotiator rejected last month central elements of Prime Minister Theresa May&rsquo;s proposals for a new trade agreement. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Friday the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without striking any deal with Brussels was &ldquo;uncomfortably high&rdquo;. Trade minister Liam Fox has put the chances at 60-40. May&rsquo;s office repeated on Monday she believed Britain would negotiate a good agreement but that &ldquo;no deal is better than a bad deal&rdquo;. The pound hit an 11-month low against the dollar on Monday with traders linking this partly to the possibility of no deal. It rose modestly on Tuesday. Following are some questions and answers about what a no-deal Brexit might mean. What will happen if Britain and the EU fail to get a deal? Britain is a member of the World Trade Organization so tariffs and other terms governing its trade with the EU would be set under WTO rules. EU tariffs are quite low, averaging about 5 percent, but they are higher for some important British exports including cars which would face a 10 percent tariff. Exporters could face other barriers including complying with EU standards for goods such as food and electrical products.  British exports might get stuck at the EU border. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many British services firms, especially in the giant financial industry, would probably face more restrictions on doing business in the bloc than under May&rsquo;s preferred deal. Under WTO rules Britain and the EU could not offer each other low tariffs, quick border checks, or close cooperation on services, unless they offered these to all WTO member states. What&rsquo;s the downside of a no-deal Brexit? Most economists say the higher the barriers are to trade with the EU, the bigger the hit for Britain. Related CoverageBrexit at breaking point? Diary dates for Britain&#x27;s EU departure The National Institute for Economic and Social Research says a no-deal Brexit would cost each person in Britain 800 pounds ($1,030) a year more than the effect of a &ldquo;soft Brexit&rdquo; under which Britain had ties to the EU similar to Norway&rsquo;s. May&rsquo;s plan would cost 500 pounds per person a year more than a soft Brexit. The impact on Britain&rsquo;s economy could be bigger still if business investment falls, aggravating slow productivity growth, or a fall in migration causes labor shortages.   What&rsquo;s the upside to a no-deal Brexit? Brexit supporters argue that WTO rules would help Britain&rsquo;s economy by making it easier for London to strike its own trade deals with faster-growing countries and regions beyond Europe. However, this would take years and Britain on its own might struggle to secure favorable terms from the likes of the United States and China. Ruth Lea, a pro-Brexit economist, said the concerns about border delays were overblown, because countries outside the EU typically declare their exports online to speed their passage. Brexit backers also say Britain could save its estimated EU divorce bill of around 39 billion pounds and spend this on public services instead. Will a no-deal Brexit mean chaos? With less than eight months until Britain leaves the EU, time is short to negotiate an agreement or prepare both sides for the possibility of no deal. Any disorderly Brexit risks delays at borders as officials struggle with a sudden introduction of new customs rules.  Britain&rsquo;s government is drawing up plans to stockpile medicines and blood products before a possible no-deal Brexit. In the worst-case scenario, Britain would fall out of EU arrangements such as the U.S.-EU aviation Open Skies agreement, possibly causing transport chaos. Financial derivatives trading would face legal uncertainty. EU citizens in Britain and British citizens in the EU would risk losing residency and other rights. Given the potential for disruption, the EU might offer to  extend the Brexit negotiation period if there were some prospect of a deal, Malcolm Barr, a JP Morgan economist, said.  &ldquo;The EU knows that a no-deal Brexit would hurt all involved and would be an enormously complex problem to manage,&rdquo; he said.       "},"a4cce52967a8cb4846862cefeaca1f06":{"title":"Brexit at breaking point? Diary dates for Britain&#x27;s EU departure","text":"LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May has less than eight months to negotiate a Brexit deal, sell it to her divided Conservative Party and win parliamentary approval. Below are significant dates as Britain nears its departure from the European Union in March:  PARLIAMENT RETURNS - Sept. 4 to 13 Lawmakers return after spending the summer in their constituencies. Conservatives will have listened to party activists, some of whom feel May&rsquo;s Brexit plan betrays promises made in the 2016 EU referendum campaign. Her minority government must pass a mountain of legislation on everything from immigration to fisheries policy before Britain leaves the EU. During the previous parliamentary session, a number of pro- and anti-Brexit Conservatives rebelled, meaning May&rsquo;s government had to survive several very close votes on trade and customs legislation in July.     EU LEADERS MEET - Sept. 20 May will discuss Brexit with the EU&rsquo;s 27 other leaders at an informal summit in Austria. Having sent ministers across the bloc to sell her plan during the summer, the meeting will signal whether this has paid off, and if a deal is possible. LABOUR CONFERENCE - Sept. 23 to 26 The opposition Labour Party could play a role in the type of Brexit Britain gets. If May cannot win round her party, she could look to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to help get her plan through parliament. Corbyn&rsquo;s team have said it does not meet their tests for what Brexit should look like. But his party is also divided and pro-EU members could press the leadership to soften their stance at Labour&rsquo;s annual conference. CONSERVATIVE CONFERENCE - Sept. 30 to Oct. 3  The Conservative Party often holds its annual conferences in a febrile atmosphere. Last year, May had a calamitous speech in which she lost her voice, was handed a resignation notice by a prankster, and the stage backdrop fell apart as she spoke. This time tensions over her Brexit plan are likely to surface as rivals use the occasion to make their pitch to grassroots members.  May will sound out support for whatever agreement she aims to reach at an EU leaders&rsquo; meeting. EUROPEAN COUNCIL - Oct. 18 May meets fellow EU leaders and the European Commission to try to seal deals on the terms of Britain&rsquo;s withdrawal and what kind of relationship it has in the future.  This should cover trade and how to prevent a return of controls on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, which will become Britain&rsquo;s only land border with the EU. These are the main areas of disagreement which have all but stalled negotiations and caused May&rsquo;s government to step up preparations for leaving without any deal. Both sides are still working toward an October deadline, although it may be possible to extend that to December and still allow time for both sides to approve the deal. An EU Council meeting is also planned for Dec. 13-14.  PARLIAMENTARY VOTE ON BREXIT DEAL - Unscheduled If May secures a deal, she has to get parliament to approve it. Her Conservatives hold 316 seats in the 650-seat lower house, and she relies on a Northern Irish party to win parliamentary votes. To win approval, she must overcome differences between Conservatives who want a radical break with Brussels, and those who want closer ties. Otherwise, she may have to look to the opposition for support. Both paths are full of uncertainty. Failure could trigger a move against her leadership of the Conservative Party, or the government&rsquo;s collapse and an early election. BREXIT - March 29, 2019 at 2300 GMT.

Since mid-April, the dollar has gained more than 6 percent against a basket of its peers .DXY and an index of emerging market rivals .MIEM00000CUS as the U.S. central bank raised interest rates and trade tensions prompted investors to buy the greenback. But with markets expecting another three rate hikes until mid-2019, investors are wary of pushing the greenback higher with long dollar positions consolidating at a one-year high. &ldquo;Unless there is some data that can sufficiently alter the trajectory of U.S. rate hikes until end of next year, we think the dollar&rsquo;s upward march has stalled for now,&rdquo; said Jeremy Stretch, head of G10 FX strategy at CIBC Capital Markets in London. Of the three rate hikes penciled in by markets, investors expect roughly two of them through the remainder of this year after two rate hikes so far in 2018. Monthly jobs data last week signaled an economy well in expansion mode and inflation data due later this week is likely to show price pressures remain firm. A Reuters poll predicts a 3 percent print in July inflation. But more economists believe the U.S. economy is exhibiting signs of a late cycle expansion mode pointing to the narrowing gap between short-end U.S. interest rates and long term bond yields as an indicator.  High yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar were the biggest beneficiary of the weakness in the greenback. The Aussie AUD=D3 rallied more than half a percent to a one-week high at $0.7441 against the greenback after the central bank kept policy settings on hold and the Chinese stock market rallied strongly towards the close, boosting risk appetite.     The euro EUR=EBS climbed a quarter of a percent higher at 1.1583 on Tuesday after falling to $1.1530 on Monday, its lowest since June 28 after monthly German industrial orders missed forecasts.

Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose government has been accused of a slow response, said Greece must no longer allow illegal construction that has been common for decades in a country dogged by bureaucracy and corruption. The demolition of 3,200 buildings will start immediately in the Attica region, which includes the capital Athens, he said. &ldquo;The chaos of unruly construction, which threatens human lives, can no longer be tolerated,&rdquo; Tsipras said in a speech in the town of Lavrio, down the coast from Mati where at least 91 people died in the blaze on July 23. Unlicensed constructions are a common feature of the Greek landscape where they even have a name: &ldquo;afthereta&rdquo;, or &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo; buildings.  Built with apparent impunity, many are rubber stamped later under general amnesties, announced by successive governments in what critics say is a crude but effective way to wield power and gain votes. FILE PHOTO: Burned cars are seen following a wildfire at the village of Mati, near Athens, Greece, July 24, 2018. REUTERS\/Costas Baltas\/File Photo Authorities say there were dozens of such buildings in Mati, where people were trapped, with routes to the coast walled off \u2014 illegal under Greek law.  Tsipras said anyone in the process of building unlicensed constructions would be compelled to demolish them.   The disaster has had political repercussions. The head of the civil protection department resigned on Monday, a day after the government replaced the chiefs of the police and the fire brigade. The civil protection minister resigned on Friday after saying he believed there had been few flaws with the way emergency services tackled the blaze, fueled by winds blowing at 120 km (70 miles) an hour. Tsipras&rsquo;s administration has rejected opposition claims that authorities were napping on the job, saying unlicensed building had thrived under previous governments. &ldquo;I would have expected at least the tiniest bit of self-criticism from those who, along with their families, ran the country for more than four decades - not two, three or five years,&rdquo; said Tsipras, a leftist politician elected in 2015. Kyriakos Mitsotakis, head of the main opposition New Democracy Party, is son of Constantine Mitsotakis, a former prime minister. Fofi Gennimata, head of the small Socialist party which was also dominant for years, is the daughter of a key figure in that party.

They arrested four people on suspicion of trafficking and closed the home that has been operating in Deoria district in northern Uttar Pradesh, 325 km (200 miles) from the state capital Lucknow, police said after Monday&rsquo;s rescue. This is the second instance of sexual abuse in homes for destitute children in less than a month after 29 girls were alleged to have been raped and tortured in Bihar state, sparking national outrage and demands for such homes to be investigated. Sexual and physical abuse are common in care homes, where many children are not orphans but placed in care by parents who are too poor to feed, clothe and shelter them, campaigners say. &ldquo;We have sealed the shelter home and arrested a couple who managed the shelter,&rdquo; said Ganesh Prasad Saha, a senior police official in Deoria. He did not give details about the other two arrested. A case of alleged trafficking and illegal adoption has been registered. Local media reports said 18 girls were missing from the Uttar Pradesh shelter home run by the couple, but Saha said the police could not confirm that. Deoria district magistrate Amit Kishore confirmed the four arrests and said the authorities had previously revoked the shelter home&rsquo;s license, but it had remained open.  Media reports said Uttar Pradesh&rsquo;s Women and Child Welfare Department revoked the license in June 2017 after detecting large-scale irregularities. India has about 7,300 care shelters, which are home to some 230,000 children, the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights estimates. About 1,300 of them are unregistered, which means they operate illegally with little or no oversight. On Tuesday, India&rsquo;s Supreme Court criticized the state government in Bihar for allowing such shelters to run without oversight. &ldquo;You are financing these shelter homes. But such incidents are happening,&rdquo; the court said. More than 100 cases of women being raped were reported daily in India in 2016, according to the latest available government data, and it has been tightening its rape laws. It introduced the death penalty this year for those raping girls under 12.

What it might mean for Britain","text":"LONDON\/GENEVA (Reuters) - The prospect of a &ldquo;no-deal Brexit&rdquo; appears to have grown after the European Union&rsquo;s negotiator rejected last month central elements of Prime Minister Theresa May&rsquo;s proposals for a new trade agreement. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said on Friday the possibility of Britain leaving the EU without striking any deal with Brussels was &ldquo;uncomfortably high&rdquo;. Trade minister Liam Fox has put the chances at 60-40. May&rsquo;s office repeated on Monday she believed Britain would negotiate a good agreement but that &ldquo;no deal is better than a bad deal&rdquo;. The pound hit an 11-month low against the dollar on Monday with traders linking this partly to the possibility of no deal. It rose modestly on Tuesday. Following are some questions and answers about what a no-deal Brexit might mean. What will happen if Britain and the EU fail to get a deal? Britain is a member of the World Trade Organization so tariffs and other terms governing its trade with the EU would be set under WTO rules. EU tariffs are quite low, averaging about 5 percent, but they are higher for some important British exports including cars which would face a 10 percent tariff. Exporters could face other barriers including complying with EU standards for goods such as food and electrical products.  British exports might get stuck at the EU border. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many British services firms, especially in the giant financial industry, would probably face more restrictions on doing business in the bloc than under May&rsquo;s preferred deal. Under WTO rules Britain and the EU could not offer each other low tariffs, quick border checks, or close cooperation on services, unless they offered these to all WTO member states. What&rsquo;s the downside of a no-deal Brexit? Most economists say the higher the barriers are to trade with the EU, the bigger the hit for Britain. Related CoverageBrexit at breaking point? Diary dates for Britain&#x27;s EU departure The National Institute for Economic and Social Research says a no-deal Brexit would cost each person in Britain 800 pounds ($1,030) a year more than the effect of a &ldquo;soft Brexit&rdquo; under which Britain had ties to the EU similar to Norway&rsquo;s. May&rsquo;s plan would cost 500 pounds per person a year more than a soft Brexit. The impact on Britain&rsquo;s economy could be bigger still if business investment falls, aggravating slow productivity growth, or a fall in migration causes labor shortages.   What&rsquo;s the upside to a no-deal Brexit? Brexit supporters argue that WTO rules would help Britain&rsquo;s economy by making it easier for London to strike its own trade deals with faster-growing countries and regions beyond Europe. However, this would take years and Britain on its own might struggle to secure favorable terms from the likes of the United States and China. Ruth Lea, a pro-Brexit economist, said the concerns about border delays were overblown, because countries outside the EU typically declare their exports online to speed their passage. Brexit backers also say Britain could save its estimated EU divorce bill of around 39 billion pounds and spend this on public services instead. Will a no-deal Brexit mean chaos? With less than eight months until Britain leaves the EU, time is short to negotiate an agreement or prepare both sides for the possibility of no deal. Any disorderly Brexit risks delays at borders as officials struggle with a sudden introduction of new customs rules.  Britain&rsquo;s government is drawing up plans to stockpile medicines and blood products before a possible no-deal Brexit. In the worst-case scenario, Britain would fall out of EU arrangements such as the U.S.-EU aviation Open Skies agreement, possibly causing transport chaos. Financial derivatives trading would face legal uncertainty. EU citizens in Britain and British citizens in the EU would risk losing residency and other rights. Given the potential for disruption, the EU might offer to  extend the Brexit negotiation period if there were some prospect of a deal, Malcolm Barr, a JP Morgan economist, said.  &ldquo;The EU knows that a no-deal Brexit would hurt all involved and would be an enormously complex problem to manage,&rdquo; he said.

An outspoken atheist in a country where politicians often trumpet their piety, Karunanidhi built his political machine as a crusader for social justice, with policies aimed at helping those at the bottom of India&rsquo;s rigid Hindu caste hierarchy. Thousands of his supporters were gathered outside the hospital in state capital Chennai to mourn his demise, as scores of policemen kept watch. Roads outside the hospital and at Karunanidhi&rsquo;s residence were packed with people.  Karunanidhi, who led his party Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) for about 50 years, had been treated in hospital since July 26 for age-related ailments including urinary tract infections. His death comes less than two years after that of his bitter rival, actress-turned politician J Jayalalithaa, leaving a political void in the state. &ldquo;His understanding of policy and emphasis on social welfare stood out,&rdquo; Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted following the veteran&rsquo;s demise.

Karunanidhi, who always appeared in public with dark glasses and a yellow shawl draped on a shoulder, built his career fighting oppression by Brahmins, a priestly community at the top of the Hindu caste system. He criticized organized religion and superstition and was known for his sharp wit, command over the Tamil language and populist schemes for those at the bottom of society. Supporters on Twitter reminisced about how his scheme to offer free education to first-generation graduates had helped them. The iconoclastic leader also tried to install non-Brahmins as priests in temples. He was known for drawing foreign investors to India&rsquo;s second largest state economy, and oversaw the state becoming an industrial powerhouse, credited with opening many industrial and technology parks. Karunanidhi, who wrote scripts for Tamil cinema before entering politics, faced allegations of corruption and nepotism. Many of his close family members served as lawmakers and his son M. K. Stalin is his de facto successor. In one case involving an alleged loss to the state over construction of a bridge, police dragged Karunanidhi out of his home after midnight.

Job security was an election battle cry of Labour Minister Luigi Di Maio, leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement which has governed with the right-wing League since June 1. The package of measures, which Di Maio dubbed the &ldquo;dignity decree&rdquo;, also includes a ban on advertising of all forms of gambling, which 5-Star says hurts families&rsquo; finances and targets the weakest members of society. The upper house approved the decree, which was drawn up in early July, by 155 votes to 125. It had already been passed by the Chamber of Deputies and so now becomes law. The legislation aims to fulfill Di Maio&rsquo;s campaign promise to stop abuse of temporary contracts after former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi passed a law to liberalize their use. To discourage such contracts, the package increases costs for firms that use them, and reduces the number of times they can be renewed to a maximum of two years from three. Most of Italy&rsquo;s employers&rsquo; associations, whose members make heavy use of temporary contracts, have criticized the changes, which opinion polls show have strong voter support. &ldquo;This is the first decree for decades that hasn&rsquo;t been dictated by lobbies and vested interests,&rdquo; Di Maio said after the Senate vote. &ldquo;Finally ordinary people have scored a point.&rdquo; FILE PHOTO: Italian Minister of Labor and Industry Luigi Di Maio speaks at the Italian Business Association Confcommercio meeting in Rome, Italy, June 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Tony Gentile\/File Photo Italy has repeatedly reformed its hiring and firing rules in recent years as part of efforts to spur growth in the euro zone&rsquo;s third-largest economy. But the changes have failed to overcome a &ldquo;dual&rdquo; labor market in which older workers hired under previous, rigid rules enjoy strong job protection, while younger people usually find only temporary work with few rights or benefits. Some 394,000 temporary jobs were created in the 12 months to June, the most recent figures show, while the number of permanent contracts declined by 83,000. The decree also increases the compensation companies must pay workers ruled by a court to have been wrongfully dismissed.  Attempting to keep work in Italy, the legislation rules that firms that have received state financial support or tax breaks and then move their production abroad must pay back the money they received, and can also be fined. Those that relocate outside Italy within five years of receiving government funds must pay back between double and four times the amount received. A poll by the IPSOS agency showed support of 55 percent to 75 percent for the measures in the decree, with the strongest backing for the penalties on firms moving production abroad, higher compensation for wrongful dismissal and the ban on gambling ads. During its passage through parliament, the government also introduced financial incentives for companies to hire young people on open-ended contracts.

Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 rose 89 cents to $74.64 per barrel by 10:18 a.m. EDT (1418 GMT) and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were up 52 cents at $69.53 a barrel. The first U.S. sanctions against OPEC member Iran officially came into effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT. These sanctions did not include Iran&rsquo;s oil exports. The country exported almost 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July. The reimposed sanctions target Iran&rsquo;s U.S. dollar purchases, metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector.   U.S. sanctions on Iran&rsquo;s energy sector are set to be re-imposed after a 180-day &ldquo;wind-down period&rdquo; ending on Nov. 4. &ldquo;It is a reality check that this is happening and that Iran&rsquo;s oil exports will be hurt when the oil sanctions hit it in November,&rdquo; chief commodities analyst at Commerzbank Bjarne Schieldrop said. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that the sanctions were &ldquo;the most biting sanctions ever imposed&rdquo;. &ldquo;Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States,&rdquo; he added. Many European countries, China and India, oppose the sanctions, but the U.S. government said it wants as many countries as possible to stop buying Iranian oil. &ldquo;The market continues to price in geopolitical risk from the reimposition of sanctions by the U.S. on Iran,&rdquo; said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. &ldquo;The reports that Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s production actually dropped in July continue to provide support for the market.&rdquo; Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s crude production dropped about 200,000 bpd last month, two sources at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Friday, despite a pledge by the Saudis and top producer Russia to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia promising a &ldquo;measurable&rdquo; supply boost. Also supporting prices were a weakened dollar, McGillian said. The dollar index .DXY was trading 0.2 percent lower.[USD\/]  A weak dollar can lift the price of commodities, like oil, that are priced using the currency.  U.S. crude stockpiles were also expected to have dropped last week. Data from the American Petroleum Institute for U.S. inventories is due later on Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. EDT, followed by the government&rsquo;s report on Wednesday morning. {EIA\/S] HEAT IMPACTS OIL Analysts also warned that a global heatwave could affect oil demand. Much of the northern hemisphere has been gripped by extreme heat this summer, pushing up demand for industrial and residential cooling.  This mostly affects demand for power fuels such as thermal coal and natural gas. &ldquo;With global demand remaining healthy and the global heatwave increasing oil demand, I think prices will remain well-supported in the near term,&rdquo; Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said.

The impoverished Arab state, known for its Sidr honey made from the jujube tree, has endured three years of war that have pushed it to the verge of famine and shattered the economy. &ldquo;Before the war...we produced large quantities of honey. [But now] honey farmers who move their private farms at night sometimes get hit by mistake,&rdquo; said Faris al-Howry, who owns one of the main honey stores in the capital Sanaa.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s happened with two or three farmers we know where their farms were bombed [in air strikes].&rdquo; A vendor pours honey at his shop in Sanaa, Yemen July 25, 2018. Picture taken July 25, 2018. REUTERS\/Khaled Abdullah A Saudi-led coalition which intervened in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government has conducted thousands of air strikes in its battle against the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement which controls the most populous areas of Yemen, including Sanaa. Some air strikes have hit civilian targets, although the coalition denies doing so intentionally. Houthi fighters have also placed landmines in territory under their control. Yemen exported 50,000 tonnes of honey per year before the war but exports have since fallen by more than 50 percent, according to the Federation of Yemeni Beekepers, which says there are around 100,000 people working in honey farms in Yemen.  &ldquo;Breeders must now be mindful that when they&rsquo;re trying to move from location to location, they could be targeted or bombed by mistake,&rdquo; said Abdullah Abdullah Yareem, head of the Yemeni Organization for Honey and Agriculture Development. He was speaking at a honey farm in al-Mahwit governorate where men tended to wooden hive boxes as bees flitted between sunflowers in a field. Slideshow (14 Images)  He added it has also become costlier to export honey due to stringent measures imposed on maritime flows by the Saudi-backed coalition, which accuses the Houthis of smuggling Iranian-made weapons, a charge denied by the group and Tehran. There is only one outlet - to Saudi Arabia, so all exports must flow through there, said Abdullah.  &ldquo;This has created a problem that raised transportation costs making the product reach the consumer at a very high price.&rdquo; Howry said business is bad as few people could afford luxuries. The price of honey in Yemen ranges from $100 for 1 kilo of Sidr to $68 for less premium types. Outside of Yemen the honey sell for around $180 dollars per kilo. &ldquo;Sales are down 75 percent...There is no income, no salaries and no spending,&rdquo; he said in the store, where boxes of honeycomb are on display on the counter.

Orhan Dzhemal, Alexander Rastorguyev and Kirill Radchenko were killed about 200 km (125 miles) northeast of the volatile African state&rsquo;s capital Bangui, according to local officials. The Russian Foreign Ministry has said the three men were killed during a robbery, but colleagues of the dead journalists have launched an investigation into their murders, the circumstances of which they say remain unclear.       &ldquo;We have been orphaned,&rdquo; documentary maker Pavel Kostomarov told a group of mourners, many in tears, outside a church in central Moscow following a wake for filmmaker Rastorguyev. Some of the mourners held the dead journalist&rsquo;s portrait.  Outside a mosque in northern Moscow, the son of slain journalist Orhan Dzhemal addressed hundreds who had come to pay their respects. &ldquo;People like him are rare. If there were just a few more people like him, the world would be a much better place,&rdquo; Mansour, Dzhemal&rsquo;s young son, said. &ldquo;His whole life was a heroic act, a fight for justice and against oppression,&rdquo; fellow journalist Maksim Shevchenko told mourners, who had carried Dzhemal&rsquo;s casket into the mosque. &ldquo;He always came to the aid of the weak, he was always on the side of those who were threatened with danger,&rdquo; said Shevchenko. Radchenko was laid to rest in a closed ceremony, the Ekho Moskvy radio station reported.   The three men were on assignment for TsUR, an online news organization funded by anti-Kremlin campaigner and former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Their trip was fraught with issues from the start. They were forced to change their plans at the last minute, they struggled to communicate with their driver, and had inconsistent contact with their fixer. Central African Republic has been ravaged by violence, with most of the country beyond the control of its central government. Russian officials have said the journalists were sent on the mission with inadequate planning for such a dangerous environment. Khodorkovsky has said the journalists were experienced war correspondents who made their own decisions about security and were given the resources they asked for.

Tshisekedi heads the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) and is the son of late opposition icon Etienne Tshisekedi. A nationwide poll placed him in a joint lead in December&rsquo;s presidential race with 19 percent of the vote. The clashes lasted about 10 minutes, a local journalist who witnessed them said.  Wednesday is the deadline to submit candidacies for the election, and all eyes are on President Joseph Kabila, who has yet to commit publicly to bowing out despite being barred from standing by term limits.  Repeated delays to the poll, originally scheduled for November 2016, and Kabila&rsquo;s refusal to quit at the end of his mandate the following month have provoked protests in which security forces killed dozens of demonstrators. Western powers and Congo&rsquo;s neighbors fear chaos if Kabila digs in and decides to run, with the vast central African country still reeling from wars since the 1990s that killed millions, most from hunger and disease, and spawned dozens of militia groups, many of which are still active. The clashes between the police and the hundreds of Tshisekedi supporters who ran and drove motorcycles alongside his car on the way to the commission headquarters marked the first violence of the registration period, which opened two weeks ago.  Kabila is due to meet members of his electoral coalition, the Common Front for Congo (FCC), on Tuesday afternoon at his farm outside Kinshasa. Some of his allies have floated legal arguments which they said would justify his seeking a third term but Kabila has remained silent about his intentions except to say that he will respect the constitution.

The Syrian military was hit by major defections in the first years of the conflict, which began in 2011, and by 2015 Assad acknowledged that &ldquo;a shortfall in human capacity&rdquo; meant the army could not fight everywhere for fear of losing vital ground.  Russia intervened militarily soon afterwards to turn the tide of war and has been helping arm and train the Syrian army. Iran has also backed Assad, sending military advisers and allied Shi&rsquo;ite militia from across the region to support his troops.  Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman delivers statement during his visit at an army drill in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, Israel, August 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Amir Cohen Pro-government forces in the Syrian conflict have also included local militias raised by the Lebanese Hezbollah with Iranian support, including the National Defence Forces. [8N1NS4H5]     &ldquo;Across the way we see the Syrian military, which is not satisfied with just taking over all of Syrian territory but is expressly building a broad-based, new ground army that will return to its previous proportions and beyond,&rdquo; Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman told reporters during a tour of the Golan Heights.      Israel closely monitors the military capacity of Syria, an adversary against which it has fought three wars. It captured part of the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and has occupied it since.   With Assad now regaining control, Israel has voiced worry that he might defy a 44-year-old Golan demilitarisation deal that had stabilised their standoff. Slideshow (5 Images)  In a Twitter statement, Lieberman said that Israel&rsquo;s tanks, deployed on parts of the strategic plateau that it captured from Syria in a 1967 war, were &ldquo;our crushing strike force and will know how to defend the border in any eventuality&rdquo;.   In a May interview, Assad also said Syria had improved its air defences with Russian help.     The Golan saw large tank battles in 1967 and the subsequent Israel-Syria war in 1973.

The crash occurred on Saturday when one of the airline&rsquo;s midcentury JU-52 aircraft went into a nosedive on the west side of the Piz Segnas mountain in the canton of Grissons. The cause of the incident \u2014 which occurred hours after a family of four was killed when their small plane went down further west in the Alps \u2014 remains under investigation and could take weeks or months to determine, authorities said.  The effort is complicated by the vintage plane&rsquo;s lack of a &ldquo;black box&rdquo; flight recording device. &ldquo;We plan to resume flights on August 17 unless we receive any indications until then that safety might be a concern,&rdquo; JU-Air spokesman Christian Gartmann said. &ldquo;At the moment we don&rsquo;t have any indication that it would be unsafe to resume flight.&rdquo; The country&rsquo;s aviation authority, the Federal Office of Civil Aviation, said that so long as there is no firm suspicion of a technical defect, it cannot order the grounding of the airline&rsquo;s fleet. The airline would need to ensure its crew and maintenance staff were psychologically fit for flight, the federal office warned, adding it would take additional measures, including issuing a temporary flight ban if necessary, should pertinent information surface meanwhile. The plane hit the ground nearly vertically and at high speed, authorities determined. It was heading north past the Martinsloch rock window, when \u2014 instead of flying over the ridge \u2014 it made a sharp curve and suddenly tilted into a nosedive, an eyewitness said. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t take 15 seconds,&rdquo; eyewitness Raini Feldner told Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger. Established in 1982, JU-Air offers sightseeing, charter and adventure flights on mid-century Junkers Ju-52 aircraft decommissioned by the Swiss Air Force and known affectionately in German as &ldquo;Auntie Ju&rdquo; planes. The crash of the aircraft, built in the late 1930s as a military aircraft, was the first time the airline had had an accident resulting in death or injury to passengers or crew members, the airline&rsquo;s chief executive said. Recovery works were wrapped up at the site on Tuesday, the office of Switzerland&rsquo;s attorney general said, with the surrounding area once again opened to hikers.  &ldquo;Under coordination of the attorney general&rsquo;s office, formal identification of the victims will now be carried out, and our investigations and clarifications will continue,&rdquo; the authority said in a statement.

(Reuters) - Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort&rsquo;s right-hand man testified at trial on Tuesday that Manafort instructed him not to tell their firm&rsquo;s bookkeeper about payments from accounts in Cyprus that held millions of dollars in earnings from  consulting work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Rick Gates, the U.S. government&rsquo;s star witness in Manafort&rsquo;s trial on tax fraud and bank fraud charges, told a federal court jury in Alexandria, Virginia, that there were hundreds of emails showing Manafort approved payments out of the Cypriot accounts. Gates&rsquo; testimony on the trial&rsquo;s sixth day was part of the prosecution&rsquo;s effort to prove that Manafort was responsible for financial maneuverings that he and other witnesses have testified include filing false tax returns and failing to report foreign bank accounts. Gates, Manafort&rsquo;s long-time business partner, is expected to face a tough cross-examination later on Tuesday by defense lawyers in the first trial to arise from Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The Kremlin denies election meddling. While outside the scope of the trial, Mueller is also investigating whether Trump campaign members coordinated with Moscow, an allegation President Donald Trump denies. Manafort&rsquo;s defense is seeking to pin the blame on Gates himself, who has acknowledged embezzling from Manafort&rsquo;s firm. Manafort, 69, has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank fraud, tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. Gates, who also was an official on Trump&rsquo;s campaign, pleaded guilty in February to lying to investigators and conspiring to defraud the United States and agreed to cooperate.  Rick Gates (R), a longtime business associate of U.S. President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort (front L), testifies on the fifth day of the trial of Manafort, on bank and tax fraud charges stemming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, U.S., August 6, 2018. Judge T.S. Ellis (rear C) looks on.  REUTERS\/Bill Hennessy   On Tuesday, Gates also testified about &ldquo;modified&rdquo; invoices for payments to U.S. vendors that he said he created at Manafort&rsquo;s request. The invoices were created to meet document requirements of a bank, Gates said, adding that the payments were legitimate. He testified about a complex scheme in which earnings from Manafort&rsquo;s political work in Ukraine would be paid by Ukrainian businessmen using companies in Cyprus to other Cyprus-based companies controlled by Manafort. Prosecutors showed contracts laying out that Manafort would be paid $4 million a year in quarterly installments of $1 million, all channeled through Cyprus. The funds were logged as loans, but Gates testified they were in fact compensation to Manafort. Money from the Ukraine work dried up after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was forced from power in 2014, Gates testified. A $1 million payment for work in 2014 was &ldquo;significantly past due&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Manafort was quite upset the money had not been sent,&rdquo; Gates told the court. Manafort&rsquo;s Kiev-based aide Konstantin Kilimnik was able to collect $500,000, Gates said, but &ldquo;to my knowledge it was never paid in full.&rdquo; Kilimnik was indicted in the Mueller investigation in June.  Gates, 46, testified on Monday that he helped falsify Manafort&rsquo;s tax returns and hide his foreign bank accounts. He testified that he has met with prosecutors about 20 times. It is unclear what other information he may have provided to Mueller&rsquo;s team. Gates admitted on Monday that he did steal money through inflated expense reports, but he said it was hundreds of thousands of dollars, not millions as defense lawyers stated. Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers are expected to use the theft to try to undermine Gates&rsquo; credibility as a witness. They also are likely to bring up his making false statements to investigators.    One issue that could be a challenge for prosecutors on Tuesday is the extent to which they are allowed to admit evidence about Manafort&rsquo;s Ukraine work and the oligarchs who paid him. On Monday, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis repeatedly clashed with prosecutors about the relevance of such testimony and once again urged them to speed things along.

On Sunday, a federal judge in the northern state of Roraima ordered the border closed until the state could create &ldquo;humanitarian&rdquo; conditions to receive a massive influx of Venezuelans, who have overwhelmed state social services and caused a growing humanitarian crisis. Appeals court judge Kassio Marques acknowledged &ldquo;grave violations of the public and judicial order,&rdquo; but overturned the lower court&rsquo;s ruling. He said the closure would not help to improve humanitarian conditions for Venezuelans fleeing their country, as the federal prosecutors and public defenders offices who brought the case had argued. The Brasilia-based judge&rsquo;s decision was cited in a statement by the Solicitor General&rsquo;s office.

A state government official in Roraima said that although the federal police never closed the border, officers did momentarily stop Venezuelans entering.  &ldquo;They only let pass those who had been granted asylum, residency or could prove they has passage out of the country,&rdquo; the official told Reuters. &ldquo;There was even a little protest.&rdquo;  The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) welcomed the Brazilian judiciary&rsquo;s decision.

Venezuela is in the grip of a severe economic crisis, with people going short of food, medicines and other essentials, and periodic waves of protests against the country&rsquo;s leftist president, Nicolas Maduro. In appealing Sunday&rsquo;s ruling, the Solicitor General&rsquo;s office said closing the border in Roraima would likely do little to stem the flow of Venezuelans, as the border is so extensive.  The Brazilian Air Force began flying Venezuelan immigrants in Roraima to other cities of Brazil in May and has so far flown more than 800 Venezuelans out of Boa Vista, the state capital.

It is the first such incident since Nigeria became a democracy in 1999 and coincides with increased tension between the National Assembly and the executive ahead of an election in Feb. 2019 when President Muhammadu Buhari will seek a second term. For some, it revived memories of the decades when the military and security forces held sway over politics in a country that has one of Africa&rsquo;s largest economies. Armed men wearing the black uniform of the Department of State Security (DSS) stood at the gates of the building in the capital Abuja and were later joined by police officers blocking entry for up to an hour, witnesses said. Members of security forces block the entrance of the National Assembly in Abuja, Nigeria August 7, 2018. REUTERS\/Afolabi Sotunde Images of the incident were shared widely on social media.   A spokesman for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said in a statement that DSS head Lawal Musa Daura had been fired. Osinbajo is acting president for Buhari, who last week left for a 10-day holiday in Britain. &ldquo;The unlawful act, which was done without the knowledge of the presidency, is condemnable and completely unacceptable,&rdquo; said a separate statement issued later by Osinbajo&rsquo;s office. It described the move as an &ldquo;unauthorized takeover of the National Assembly complex&rdquo; which was &ldquo;a gross violation of constitutional order, rule of law and all accepted notions of law and order&rdquo;.  The statement gave no reason for Daura&rsquo;s dismissal. Slideshow (3 Images)  The blockade followed the defection of around 50 lawmakers from Buhari&rsquo;s ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) party to the main opposition in the last few weeks. These included the country&rsquo;s third most senior elected official, Senate President Bukola Saraki. The defections cost the APC its Senate majority and present a challenge to Buhari&rsquo;s re-election bid because most of those who left joined the opposition People&rsquo;s Democratic Party which ruled Nigeria from 1999 until Buhari took office in May 2015. Saraki&rsquo;s supporters said the blockade was part of a plan to impeach and replace him. Parliament went on recess last week until Sept. 25 but meetings were to be held on Tuesday.  After the blockade, Saraki&rsquo;s supporters greeted him with chanting in the parliament building.  &ldquo;The presidency&rsquo;s sack of Daura was a damage-control stunt and a knee-jerk gimmick which came as a response to the national and international outcry against the armed invasion of our legislature,&rdquo; said a PDP statement. The ruling party said attempts to blame its leaders for Tuesday&rsquo;s blockade were &ldquo;false allegations&rdquo; and &ldquo;mischievous&rdquo;.  &ldquo;The use of armed security agents to force political outcomes does not bode well for the February 2019 general election,&rdquo; said Malte Liewerscheidt, vice president at Teneo Intelligence, in a note.

The Belarusian Association of Journalists and local media said five people had been detained for a period of three days and several more detained for questioning. Reuters could not independently confirm that information.   Investigators said they had opened a criminal case against two editors from the privately-owned independent news website  &ldquo;Tut.by&rdquo;, the biggest online news portal in the country with 800,000 daily unique users, and against one journalist from the independent news agency BelaPAN. Local rights groups said the arrests were part of a government drive to muzzle independent media. Last year, the Belarusian authorities put down peaceful opposition protests in a severe crackdown which ended a brief period during which the government had eased its authoritarian rule.  &ldquo;Without the knowledge or agreement of the republican  unitary enterprise (BelTA), information held on its computer system was accessed illegally more than 15,000 times over a two-year period,&rdquo; investigators said in a statement. Nasha niva, another independent news website, cited a representative of BelTA as saying the detained journalists had used other people&rsquo;s passwords to access its news wire. Yuri Zisser, the owner of Tut.by, told Reuters that BelTA had never complained before about the use of its information. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really confused and don&rsquo;t understand what this is about and why it&rsquo;s needed,&rdquo; he said. Ales Lipai, the director of BelaPAN, said the case was a mystery that had come out of the blue. &ldquo;All of BelTA&rsquo;s material is freely available. It&rsquo;s written on their website that you can use their material as long as you provide attribution, which is what we did.&rdquo; A spokesman for the Council of Europe&rsquo;s secretary general called on the Belarusian authorities to free the detained journalists and conduct a transparent investigation.  A spokesman for the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said the detentions had nothing to do with freedom of speech. &ldquo;This is purely a legal matter,&rdquo; the ministry said in a statement. Andrei Bastunets, head of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, said government pressure on independent media had been on the rise in the last year. &ldquo;I link this (case) with the general trend and the desire to control the internet space,&rdquo; he said of the detentions. President Alexander Lukashenko has run Belarus along Soviet-style command lines since 1994. He has heeded some calls from the West to show more leniency toward political opposition, but opponents say their freedom to operate remains severely limited.

Kabila, in power since 2001, is barred by term limits from running for re-election but has refused to commit publicly to not standing. That has raised fears he might do so anyway, which  risks throwing the volatile central African country into chaos.  Security forces have killed dozens of protesters since Kabila refused to quit power at the end of mandate in December 2016, saying the government was not yet prepared to hold the election to succeed him. Militia violence in the eastern borderlands with Rwanda and Uganda has also risen. Western powers and Congo&rsquo;s neighbors fear even worse violence across the country if Kabila digs in and runs, with memories still fresh of civil wars around the turn of the century that killed millions, most from hunger and disease.  The presidency invited journalists to the meeting on Tuesday afternoon at Kabila&rsquo;s farm in the village of Kingakati, about 80 km (50 miles) outside the capital Kinshasa, but it did not provide specifics about the agenda.  A Reuters reporter saw members of Kabila&rsquo;s electoral coalition, the Common Front for Congo (FCC), enter the farm, including Communications Minister Lambert Mende, Commerce Minister Jean-Lucien Bussa and the president of the lower house of parliament, Aubin Minaku.  Minaku has been tipped as one of the candidates to emerge as Kabila&rsquo;s chosen successor, as has former prime minister Augustin Matata Ponyo.  Several opposition candidates have also registered their candidacies for the Dec. 23 vote. They include former vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba, who was recently acquitted of war crimes at the International Criminal Court, and Vital Kamerhe, who finished third in the 2011 election.  On Tuesday, Felix Tshisekedi, the president of Congo&rsquo;s largest opposition party, the UDPS, and son of the late opposition icon Etienne Tshisekedi, filed his candidacy at the electoral commission headquarters in Kinshasa. As Tshisekdi drove to the headquarters, clashes briefly broke out between supporters of his, who threw rocks, and police officers, who riposted with volleys of teargas, witnesses said.

Traders said they had received an official notice from the Saudi Grains Organization (SAGO) about its decision. Canada on Monday refused to back down in its defense of human rights after Saudi Arabia froze new trade and investment and expelled the Canadian ambassador in retaliation for Ottawa&rsquo;s call to free arrested Saudi civil society activists.  &ldquo;As of Tuesday August 7, 2018, Saudi Grains Organization (SAGO) can no longer accept milling wheat or feed barley cargoes of Canadian origin to be supplied,&rdquo; a copy of the notice seen by Reuters said. One European trader said it was not clear if the decision involved only new purchases or delivery of previously agreed contracts. &ldquo;But I would not deliver Canadian grains to Saudi Arabia now, even on previous contracts,&rdquo; the trader added. Another trader said: &ldquo;This is to me clearly part of the diplomatic dispute between Saudi Arabia and Canada, there is no other reason.&rdquo; The SAGO agency usually gives sellers the freedom to select the origin of wheat purchased in its international tenders, generally specifying it must be sourced from the European Union, North America, South America or Australia. In SAGO&rsquo;s last purchase of 625,000 tonnes of wheat in an international tender on July 16, Canada was seen as a possible supplier.  One Middle Eastern grain consultant said the decision was not a great loss to Canada, though. &ldquo;Both Canada and the U.S. lost the Middle East market a long time ago ... because they are at a freight disadvantage (with higher ocean shipping costs) to the EU and Black Sea export markets,&rdquo; the consultant said.  &ldquo;The only class of wheat that Canada still exports to the region is durum but even that is not that much.&rdquo; &ldquo;So neither Saudi nor Canada are going to be affected much by stopping the wheat and barley trade.&rdquo; According to Statistics Canada, the Canadian government&rsquo;s statistics agency, total Canadian wheat sales to Saudi Arabia excluding durum were 66,000 tonnes in 2017 and 68,250 tonnes in 2016.

The dissenting judge from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals&rsquo; 2-1 decision accused the majority of ignoring legal precedent and said the Supreme Court may need to weigh in. Tuesday&rsquo;s decision allows Araceli Rodriguez to sue the agent Lonnie Swartz over the Oct. 10, 2012 shooting of 16-year-old Jose Antonio Elena Rodriguez. The boy had been walking down a street in Nogales, Mexico when Swartz, then on duty and standing on an embankment on U.S. soil, fired through a border fence, striking him about 10 times. Swartz said he acted in self-defense in response to a group of rock throwers, while Rodriguez said her son was walking  peacefully. A Tucson, Arizona federal jury in April acquitted Swartz of second-degree murder, and deadlocked on lesser manslaughter charges. A retrial on those charges was scheduled for Oct. 23. In the civil case, a lower court judge rejected Swartz&rsquo;s claim of qualified immunity, and said Rodriguez could seek damages for violations of her son&rsquo;s constitutional rights. During his appeal, Swartz adopted an argument offered by the U.S. Department of Justice that Rodriguez lacked a so-called &ldquo;Bivens&rdquo; claim against him for violating the Fourth Amendment. But in Tuesday&rsquo;s majority opinion, Circuit Judge Andrew Kleinfeld found it &ldquo;inconceivable that any reasonable officer&rdquo; to think he or she could kill Elena Rodriguez, as the mother suggested, &ldquo;for no reason.&rdquo; Kleinfeld distinguished a 1990 Supreme Court precedent limiting the Fourth Amendment&rsquo;s extraterritorial reach, saying Swartz &ldquo;acted on American soil subject to American law&rdquo; and it was &ldquo;clearly established&rdquo; he could not shoot across the border. He also said Swartz&rsquo;s conduct might &ldquo;shock[] the conscience.&rdquo; Swartz&rsquo;s lawyer Sean Chapman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. &ldquo;The court made clear that the Constitution does not stop at the border,&rdquo; said Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing Rodriguez. &ldquo;The ruling could not have come at a more important time, when [the Trump] administration is seeking to further militarize the border.&rdquo; Circuit Judge Milan Smith dissented, saying it was for Congress to extend Bivens, and that another federal appeals court reached the opposite result in a similar case. He said the majority &ldquo;tees up our court for a new &lsquo;chastening&rsquo;&rdquo; by the Supreme Court, known for often reversing 9th Circuit decisions. The case is Rodriguez v Swartz, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 15-16410.

The Kremlin denies election meddling. U.S. President Donald Trump has called for the investigation to be shut down. One part of Gates&rsquo; testimony led to some laughter in the courtroom.   &ldquo;Not happy. I just saw this. WTF,&rdquo; Manafort wrote to Gates in an email entered into evidence showing Manafort&rsquo;s reaction when he learned how much money he would have to pay in 2014 taxes. Gates, 46, said that he helped create documents to convert some income to a loan to lower Manafort&rsquo;s tax bill. &ldquo;You created a loan agreement for a loan that didn&rsquo;t exist?&rdquo; prosecutor Greg Andres asked him. &ldquo;Yes, we did,&rdquo; he replied. Manafort, 69, has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank fraud, tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts. Manafort&rsquo;s defense is seeking to pin the blame on Gates himself, who has acknowledged embezzling from Manafort&rsquo;s firm. Gates, who also was an official on Trump&rsquo;s campaign, pleaded guilty in February to lying to investigators and conspiring to defraud the United States. He agreed to cooperate and testified in court that he has met with prosecutors about 20 times. It is unclear what other information he may have provided to Mueller&rsquo;s investigation, which so far has led to the indictments or guilty pleas of 32 people and three companies. On Tuesday, Gates also testified about &ldquo;modified&rdquo; invoices for payments to U.S. vendors that he said were created at Manafort&rsquo;s request to meet document requirements for wire transfers out of Manafort&rsquo;s accounts in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The payments were legitimate even if the invoices were fake, Gates said. He testified about a complex scheme in which earnings from Manafort&rsquo;s political work in Ukraine would be paid by Ukrainian businessmen using companies in Cyprus to other Cyprus-based companies controlled by Manafort. Prosecutors showed contracts laying out that Manafort would be paid $4 million a year in quarterly installments of $1 million, all channeled through Cyprus. The funds were logged as loans in order to meet later audits in Cyprus that required documentation of transfers between bank accounts, but Gates testified they were in fact compensation to Manafort. &ldquo;A lot of these loan agreements are backdated,&rdquo; Gates said. Money from the Ukraine work dried up after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was forced from power in 2014, Gates testified. A $1 million payment for work in 2014 was &ldquo;significantly past due&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Manafort was quite upset the money had not been sent,&rdquo; Gates told the court. Manafort&rsquo;s Kiev-based aide Konstantin Kilimnik was able to collect $500,000, Gates said, but &ldquo;to my knowledge it was never paid in full.&rdquo; Kilimnik was indicted in the Mueller investigation in June.  While outside the scope of the trial, Mueller is also investigating whether Trump campaign members coordinated with Russian officials, an allegation Trump denies. Gates admitted in testimony on Monday that he did steal money through inflated expense reports, but he said it was hundreds of thousands of dollars, not millions as defense lawyers stated. Manafort&rsquo;s lawyers are expected to use the theft to try to undermine Gates&rsquo; credibility as a witness. They also are likely to bring up his making false statements to investigators.    One issue that could be a challenge for prosecutors on Tuesday is the extent to which they are allowed to admit evidence about Manafort&rsquo;s Ukraine work and the oligarchs who paid him. On Monday, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis repeatedly clashed with prosecutors about the relevance of such testimony.

(Reuters) - Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort&rsquo;s longtime aide testified at trial on Tuesday that Manafort instructed him not to tell their firm&rsquo;s bookkeeper about payments from accounts in Cyprus that held millions of dollars in earnings from  consulting work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine.

But the OPEC member nation is still fulfilling less than 60 percent of its obligations under supply deals with customers. Venezuela has been pumping oil this year at the lowest rate in three decades after years of underinvestment and a mass exodus of workers. The state-run firm&rsquo;s collapse has left the country short of cash to fund its embattled socialist government and triggered an economic crisis. PDVSA&rsquo;s problems were compounded in May when U.S. oil firm ConocoPhillips (COP.N ) began seizing PDVSA assets in the Caribbean as payment for a $2 billion arbitration award. An arbitration panel at the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ordered PDVSA to pay the cash to compensate Conoco for expropriating the firm&rsquo;s Venezuelan assets in 2007. The seizures left PDVSA without access to facilities such as Isla refinery in Curacao and BOPEC terminal in Bonaire that accounted for almost a quarter of the company&rsquo;s oil exports. Conoco&rsquo;s actions also forced PDVSA to stop shipping oil on its own vessels to terminals in the Caribbean, and then onto refineries worldwide, to avoid the risk the cargoes would be seized in international waters or foreign ports. Instead, PDVSA asked customers to charter tankers to Venezuelan waters and load from the company&rsquo;s own terminals or from anchored PDVSA vessels acting as floating storage units.  The state-run company told some clients in early June it might impose force majeure, a temporary suspension of export contracts, unless they agreed to such ship-to-ship transfers.  PDVSA also requested the customers stop sending vessels to its terminals until it could load those that were already clogging Venezuela&rsquo;s coastline. Initially, customers were reluctant to undertake the transfers because of costs, safety concerns and the need for specialist equipment and experienced crew. But PDVSA has managed to export about 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil since early July, up from just 765,000 bpd in the first half of June, according to Thomson Reuters data and internal PDVSA shipping data seen by Reuters. That was still 59 percent of the country&rsquo;s 2.19 million bpd in contractual obligations to customers for that period, and some vessels are still waiting for weeks in Venezuelan waters to load oil. There were about two dozen tankers waiting this week to load over 22 million barrels of crude and refined products at the country&rsquo;s largest ports, according to Reuters data. &ldquo;We are not tied to one option or a single loading terminal,&rdquo; PDVSA President Manuel Quevedo said on Tuesday of the company&rsquo;s exports. &ldquo;We have several (terminals) in our country and we have some in the Caribbean, which of course facilitate crude shipping to fulfill our supply contracts.&rdquo;  CUBAN CONNECTION PDVSA has also used a route through Cuba to ease the impact of the Conoco seizures. That route is for fuel rather than crude. The Venezuelan company has used a terminal at the port of Matanzas as a conduit mostly for exporting fuel oil, according to two people familiar with the operations and Thomson Reuters shipping data. Venezuela&rsquo;s fuel oil is burned in some countries to generate electricity.   Two tankers set sail from the Matanzas terminal for Singapore between mid-May and early July, Reuters data showed.    Each ship carried around 500,000 barrels of Venezuelan fuel, Reuters data shows. In recent months, Venezuela has been shipping fuel to Matanzas in small batches, according to the data. PDVSA and Cuba&rsquo;s state-run oil firm Cupet have used Matanzas to store Venezuelan crude and fuel in the past but exports from the terminal to Asian destinations are rare.  That is in part because vessels that use Cuban ports cannot subsequently dock in the United States due to the U.S. commercial embargo on Cuba. Cupet did not respond to requests for comment. PDVSA has also used ship-to-ship transfers to fulfill an unusual supply contract it has with Cuba&rsquo;s Cienfuegos refinery. The refinery dates from the 1980s - when Cuba was a close ally of the Soviet Union during the Cold War - and the facility was built to process Russian crude.  PDVSA typically uses its own or leased tankers to bring Russian crude from storage in the nearby Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao to Cienfuegos. But it is now discharging the imported Russian oil at sea in Cayman Islands&rsquo; waters via these seaborne transfers. ConocoPhillips last month ratcheted up its collection efforts by moving to depose officials from Citgo Petroleum, PDVSA&rsquo;s U.S. refining arm, arguing it had improperly claimed ownership of some PDVSA cargoes. Citgo did not respond to requests for comment.  ConocoPhillips is also preparing new legal actions to get Caribbean courts to recognize its International Chamber of Commerce arbitration award. If it succeeds in those efforts, it would be able to sell the assets to help satisfy the ruling.

Renewed U.S. sanctions against OPEC member Iran officially went into effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT. The sanctions did not include Iran&rsquo;s oil exports. The country exported almost 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July. The reimposed sanctions target Iran&rsquo;s U.S. dollar purchases, metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector.   U.S. sanctions on Iran&rsquo;s energy sector are set to be re-imposed after a 180-day &ldquo;wind-down period&rdquo; ending on Nov. 4.  &ldquo;It certainly is a reminder to everyone that the U.S. is serious about sanctions, and it&rsquo;s doubtful they will grant waivers,&rdquo; said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital Management in New York. Brent futures LCOc1 rose 90 cents, or more than 1 percent, to $74.65 a barrel by 1:38 p.m. EDT (1738 GMT), after hitting a session high of $74.90. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were up 29 cents at $69.30 a barrel, down from am earlier high of $69.83. Oil prices rose after the sanctions went into affect, but  gains were limited as market participants lacked clear signs on just how much the proposed oil sanctions would affect Iranian crude output, Kilduff said. U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that the sanctions were &ldquo;the most biting sanctions ever imposed&rdquo;. &ldquo;Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States,&rdquo; he added. Many European countries, China and India, oppose the sanctions, but the U.S. government said it wants as many countries as possible to stop buying Iranian oil. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said his country opposes sanctions on Iran, but will abide by them to protect its own interests. &ldquo;The market continues to price in geopolitical risk from the reimposition of sanctions by the U.S. on Iran,&rdquo; said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. &ldquo;The reports that Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s production actually dropped in July continue to provide support for the market.&rdquo; Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s crude production dropped about 200,000 bpd last month, two sources at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Friday, despite a pledge by the Saudis and top producer Russia to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia promising a &ldquo;measurable&rdquo; supply boost. Meanwhile, U.S. crude production, which has climbed dramatically fueled largely by increased output from shale formations, may now rise more slowly as prices drop, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration&rsquo;s monthly report. Output was expected to rise 1.31 million bpd to 10.68 million bpd in 2018, lower than last month&rsquo;s forecast of growth of 1.44 million bpd to 10.79 million, the EIA said. &ldquo;We continue to expect Brent crude oil spot prices to fall toward $70 per barrel by the end of 2018, as the market appears to be fairly balanced in the coming months,&rdquo; said Linda Capuano, EIA Administrator. U.S. crude stockpiles were expected to have dropped 3.3 million barrels last week. Weekly data from the American Petroleum Institute for U.S. inventories is due later on Tuesday at 4:30 p.m. EDT, followed by the EIA&rsquo;s report on Wednesday morning. [API\/S] [EIA\/S] HEAT IMPACTS OIL The concerns over possible supply disruptions in Iran come at a time when analysts warn that a global heatwave could increase oil demand. Much of the northern hemisphere has been gripped by extreme heat this summer, pushing up demand for industrial and residential cooling.  This mostly affects demand for power fuels such as thermal coal and natural gas. &ldquo;With global demand remaining healthy and the global heatwave increasing oil demand, I think prices will remain well-supported in the near term,&rdquo; Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said.

The yuan CNH= has strengthened to 6.8284 from 6.9122 on Friday, when China\u2019s central bank raised the cost of shorting the currency. That has helped to stem an approximately 7 percent decline since mid-June. Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday that the People&rsquo;s Bank of China is urging banks to prevent &ldquo;herd behavior&rdquo; and momentum-chasing moves in a further bid to support the currency. Hopes that the yuan may be stabilizing bolstered the euro, which has become more correlated with yuan\/dollar moves as trade tensions escalate. &ldquo;Dollar\/CNH is driving everything in G10, especially the euro,&rdquo; said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto. &ldquo;What the market was trying to figure out was, is China intentionally trying to weaken their currency or is China just letting their currency weaken?&rdquo; said McCormick. &ldquo;I think now that we&rsquo;re getting a little bit of certainty maybe it will reduce the volatility in dollar\/CNH, which in turn creates that floor for the euro at a lower end of the band.&rdquo; Positioning is also likely weighing on the greenback with speculators holding close to the most bullish bets on the dollar since January 2017, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re at a situation now where market positioning is beginning to become a little bit more of a headwind for the U.S. dollar,&rdquo; said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. The dollar index .DXY was down 0.10 percent at 95.264. It had risen to 95.652 on July 19, its highest since July 2017. It has struggled to break much above the 95.5 level, which it has tested multiple times in the past two months. The euro EUR= gained 0.24 percent against the greenback to $1.1581. It has some technical support at around $1.15. The main U.S. economic focus this week will be Friday&rsquo;s consumer price inflation report for July, which is expected to show a 0.2 percent increase in core inflation in the month, according to a Reuters poll.

The Saudi government on Sunday recalled its ambassador to Ottawa, barred Canada&rsquo;s ambassador to Riyadh and placed a ban on new trade, denouncing Canada for urging the release of rights activists. Riyadh accused Ottawa on Tuesday of interfering in its internal affairs. One well placed source said the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - which stresses the importance of human rights - planned to reach out to the United Arab Emirates. &ldquo;The key is to work with allies and friends in the region to cool things down, which can happen quickly,&rdquo; said one source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. Another source said Canada would also seek help from Britain. The British government on Tuesday urged Canada and Saudi Arabia to show restraint. The office of Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland did not respond to requests for comment. European traders said on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s main wheat-buying agency has told grains exporters it will no longer accept Canadian-origin wheat and barley. The dispute looks set to damage what is a modest bilateral trade relationship worth nearly $4 billion a year. Canadian exports to Saudi Arabia totaled about $1.12 billion in 2017, or 0.2 percent of the total value of Canadian exports. Much of that was tanks, armored personnel carriers and motor vehicles.  Saudi Arabia has ordered roughly 15,000 Saudis studying in Canada to leave.  The first source said Canada shared the view of foreign policy experts who believe the Saudi reaction reflected internal strains inside the kingdom, where 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is trying to push through domestic reforms.  The source said Canada had no regrets about speaking out on human rights in Saudi Arabia. &ldquo;What we did was in line with other countries, with what we do for families of Canadians and in line with what we have done in the past,&rdquo; said the source. The previous Conservative government also had challenges with Riyadh over human rights. Garry Keller, who was chief of staff to ex-Conservative Foreign Minister John Baird, said the government needed to look at how it could help businesses that might be affected. &ldquo;The United Arab Emirates are going to want to maintain relationships with Canada ... They are the best interlocutor for Canada in the region,&rdquo; he said.

Spokesman Lambert Mende&rsquo;s statement followed a meeting between Kabila and coalition members at his farm outside the capital Kinshasa. Candidates have until Wednesday afternoon to register with the national electoral commission.  Kabila, in power since 2001, is barred by term limits from running for re-election but has refused to commit publicly to not standing. That has raised fears he might do so anyway, which  risks throwing the volatile central African country into chaos.  Security forces have killed dozens of protesters since Kabila refused to quit power at the end of mandate in December 2016, saying the government was not yet prepared to hold the election to succeed him. Militia violence in the eastern borderlands with Rwanda and Uganda has also risen. Western powers and Congo&rsquo;s neighbors fear even worse violence across the country if Kabila digs in and runs, with memories still fresh of civil wars around the turn of the century that killed millions, most from hunger and disease.  Kabila met on Tuesday afternoon with members of his electoral coalition, the Common Front for Congo (FCC), at his farm in the village of Kingakati, about 80 km (50 miles) outside the Kinshasa. Participants in the meeting included Mende, Commerce Minister Jean-Lucien Bussa, Planning Minister Modeste Bahati and the president of the lower house of parliament, Aubin Minaku.  Minaku has been tipped as one of the candidates to emerge as Kabila&rsquo;s chosen successor, as has former prime minister Augustin Matata Ponyo.  Several opposition candidates have also registered their candidacies for the Dec. 23 vote. They include former vice president Jean-Pierre Bemba, who was recently acquitted of war crimes at the International Criminal Court, and Vital Kamerhe, who finished third in the 2011 election.  On Tuesday, Felix Tshisekedi, the president of Congo&rsquo;s largest opposition party, the UDPS, and son of the late opposition icon Etienne Tshisekedi, filed his candidacy at the electoral commission headquarters in Kinshasa. As Tshisekdi drove to the headquarters, clashes briefly broke out between supporters of his, who threw rocks, and police officers, who riposted with volleys of teargas, witnesses said. Tryphon Kin-Kiey, a Kabila ally who founded a political party called &ldquo;Kabila Desire&rdquo;, also submitted his candidacy on Tuesday as an independent, a move that was quickly disavowed by members of his political coalition.

The world&rsquo;s second-largest chipmaker by revenue has come to rely on the market for data centers - which help power most mobile and Web apps - for growth in recent years as the PC market has stagnated. But the company&rsquo;s shares dropped 8.5 on July 27, after the data center business missed Wall Street growth targets. Analysts expect AMD to eat in to Intel&rsquo;s market share with its planned launch next year of chips with a tiny 7 nanometers between transistors.  Intel chips have 14 nanometers between transistors, indicating potentially slower speed. There is some dispute about the measurements, with analysts saying Intel&rsquo;s numbers are better than headline figures convey, but AMD appears to have secured a lead for 2019. Moreover, Intel will not launch its own 10-nanometer chips in PCs until late 2019, with server chips coming in 2020. The Santa Clara, California, company, which for years boasted about its factories&rsquo; ability to make cutting-edge chips, has &ldquo;completely lost control of the narrative&rdquo; as rivals tout their more efficient plants, said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, who has a &ldquo;market underperform&rdquo; rating on Intel stock. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve made their bed, now they have to lie in it,&rdquo; he said on Monday. Navin Shenoy, Intel&rsquo;s data center chief and a 23-year veteran of the chipmaker, will lay out Intel&rsquo;s plans to Wall Street analysts on Wednesday.  His message will be that the data center market is larger and faster-growing than the company previously thought, as he lays out expectations for that market and for the first time reveals Intel&rsquo;s revenue from fast-growing fields such as artificial intelligence. While the 10-nanometer chips are expected to give Intel a shot in the arm, they will not start shipping in large volumes until 2020. Until then, Intel believes its earnings growth can outpace the overall market&rsquo;s growth if the company focuses on improving its existing chips, Shenoy told Reuters ahead of the meeting. Shenoy, who took over the data center business last summer, said he was surprised by the late July share drop after the second-quarter earnings report. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that long ago that people were asking me how we were going to grow the data center in double digits,&rdquo; he said, noting that the business grew by 26 percent in the last quarter. Intel&rsquo;s plan rests on its ability to &ldquo;stitch together&rdquo; its CPUs, the processing brains, with its memory chips, its semi-customizable computing chips and its software offerings. The company also plans to tweak its chips to make them more competitive against offerings from Nvidia Corp for artificial intelligence work. Together they will compete in costs and computing horsepower with rivals&rsquo; systems, Shenoy said. Intel plans to pair a new memory chip technology called Optane with its processors next year, gaining some capability its rivals will not have because Intel has spent the past decade inventing the technology from scratch. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited, we&rsquo;re hungry, we&rsquo;re ready to compete and we&rsquo;re ready to get after it,&rdquo; Shenoy said. But AMD is still widely expected to pick up market share over the next year, mostly based on its chips with the smaller circuits, which improve efficiency, analysts say. While Intel is behind in the chip size race, its processors are more capable than the numbers might indicate, and it is unlikely to lose its dominant place in data centers between now and 2020, said analyst Dan Hutcheson, CEO of VLSI Research Inc.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re two generations behind,&rdquo; Hutcheson said. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re kind of half a generation behind.&rdquo; "},"eb7448ec7ce5d4bc032737a4accc608c":{"title":"Intel plans array of upgrades to stave off AMD data center competition","text":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Intel Corp plans to upgrade its existing chips and combine them with a new memory technology to help stave off competition from Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) and others, its data center chief told Reuters on Monday.

The link to the full blog is: here Taking Tesla Private     The following email was sent to Tesla employees today:     Earlier today, I announced that I&rsquo;m considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420\/share. I wanted to let you know my rationale for this, and why I think this is the best path forward. First, a final decision has not yet been made, but the reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best. As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company. I fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we&rsquo;re all trying to achieve. This is especially true for a company like Tesla that has a long-term, forward-looking mission. SpaceX is a perfect example: it is far more operationally efficient, and that is largely due to the fact that it is privately held. This is not to say that it will make sense for Tesla to be private over the long-term. In the future, once Tesla enters a phase of slower, more predictable growth, it will likely make sense to return to the public markets. Here&rsquo;s what I envision being private would mean for all shareholders, including all of our employees. First, I would like to structure this so that all shareholders have a choice. Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be bought out at $420 per share, which is a 20% premium over the stock price following our Q2 earnings call (which had already increased by 16%). My hope is for all shareholders to remain, but if they prefer to be bought out, then this would enable that to happen at a nice premium. Second, my intention is for all Tesla employees to remain shareholders of the company, just as is the case at SpaceX. If we were to go private, employees would still be able to periodically sell their shares and exercise their options. This would enable you to still share in the growing value of the company that you have all worked so hard to build over time. Third, the intention is not to merge SpaceX and Tesla. They would continue to have separate ownership and governance structures. However, the structure envisioned for Tesla is similar in many ways to the SpaceX structure: external shareholders and employee shareholders have an opportunity to sell or buy approximately every six months. Finally, this has nothing to do with accumulating control for myself. I own about 20% of the company now, and I don&rsquo;t envision that being substantially different after any deal is completed. Basically, I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees, as possible. This proposal to go private would ultimately be finalized through a vote of our shareholders. If the process ends the way I expect it will, a private Tesla would ultimately be an enormous opportunity for all of us. Either way, the future is very bright and we&rsquo;ll keep fighting to achieve our mission. Thanks, Elon "},"d1e9f0e10efb50d5047bf336af284263":{"title":"Goldman Sachs under U.S. scrutiny in Malaysian fraud inquiry: NYT","text":"(Reuters) - Federal prosecutors drafted a criminal complaint against a former Goldman Sachs (GS.N ) banker early this year for his alleged role in a Malaysian fraud, but the charges were never filed because of a Justice Department turf battle, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.

The link to the full blog is: here Taking Tesla Private     The following email was sent to Tesla employees today:     Earlier today, I announced that I&rsquo;m considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420\/share. I wanted to let you know my rationale for this, and why I think this is the best path forward. First, a final decision has not yet been made, but the reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best. As a public company, we are subject to wild swings in our stock price that can be a major distraction for everyone working at Tesla, all of whom are shareholders. Being public also subjects us to the quarterly earnings cycle that puts enormous pressure on Tesla to make decisions that may be right for a given quarter, but not necessarily right for the long-term. Finally, as the most shorted stock in the history of the stock market, being public means that there are large numbers of people who have the incentive to attack the company. I fundamentally believe that we are at our best when everyone is focused on executing, when we can remain focused on our long-term mission, and when there are not perverse incentives for people to try to harm what we&rsquo;re all trying to achieve. This is especially true for a company like Tesla that has a long-term, forward-looking mission. SpaceX is a perfect example: it is far more operationally efficient, and that is largely due to the fact that it is privately held. This is not to say that it will make sense for Tesla to be private over the long-term. In the future, once Tesla enters a phase of slower, more predictable growth, it will likely make sense to return to the public markets. Here&rsquo;s what I envision being private would mean for all shareholders, including all of our employees. First, I would like to structure this so that all shareholders have a choice. Either they can stay investors in a private Tesla or they can be bought out at $420 per share, which is a 20% premium over the stock price following our Q2 earnings call (which had already increased by 16%). My hope is for all shareholders to remain, but if they prefer to be bought out, then this would enable that to happen at a nice premium. Second, my intention is for all Tesla employees to remain shareholders of the company, just as is the case at SpaceX. If we were to go private, employees would still be able to periodically sell their shares and exercise their options. This would enable you to still share in the growing value of the company that you have all worked so hard to build over time. Third, the intention is not to merge SpaceX and Tesla. They would continue to have separate ownership and governance structures. However, the structure envisioned for Tesla is similar in many ways to the SpaceX structure: external shareholders and employee shareholders have an opportunity to sell or buy approximately every six months. Finally, this has nothing to do with accumulating control for myself. I own about 20% of the company now, and I don&rsquo;t envision that being substantially different after any deal is completed. Basically, I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish an outcome where Tesla can operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible, and where there is as little change for all of our investors, including all of our employees, as possible. This proposal to go private would ultimately be finalized through a vote of our shareholders. If the process ends the way I expect it will, a private Tesla would ultimately be an enormous opportunity for all of us. Either way, the future is very bright and we&rsquo;ll keep fighting to achieve our mission. Thanks, Elon "},"7954842135f594cb26cb0f6d9135bd0c":{"title":"Goldman Sachs under U.S. scrutiny in Malaysian fraud inquiry: NYT","text":"(Reuters) - Federal prosecutors drafted a criminal complaint against a former Goldman Sachs (GS.N ) banker early this year for his alleged role in a Malaysian fraud, but the charges were never filed because of a Justice Department turf battle, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.

Daily users fell to 188 million from 191 million in the prior quarter, which could heighten investor anxiety about how competition and privacy issues are affecting Snap and its peers. The company beat analyst revenue forecasts as it drew in more international and small business advertisers but posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss.  Snap had never before logged a quarterly drop in users, according to data it has released going back to 2014. Analysts on average expected Snap to gain nearly 2 million users in the second quarter from the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  Snap&rsquo;s user growth has pulled back sharply over the past two years. Much larger rival Facebook Inc has replicated Snapchat features such as virtual animal ear filters for selfies and the &ldquo;stories&rdquo; format for sharing content. A Snapchat redesign in February aimed at encouraging users to watch more videos prompted user protests after they found it more difficult to find the content they wanted. Snap in first-quarter results said it would again adjust how it presents content.  Earnings from Facebook and Twitter Inc in recent weeks spooked social media investors by showing issues around data privacy, abusive content and phony accounts were weighing on user growth and sending expenses higher. Both companies shed some 19 percent in market value after reporting, and the results also weighed on Snap shares. Snap lost about 1 million users in each of its three geographic reporting regions: North America, Europe and rest of world. Its revenue was $262 million in the second quarter, beating the average estimate of $250.43 million, as average revenue per user surged to $1.40 from $1.05 a year ago.  The company has been working to convince big advertisers to spend more of their budgets on Snapchat ads and reach the app&rsquo;s base of mainly 18-34-year-old users, but companies have largely considered the spending experimental.    Snapchat is popular for private messaging, but most of the ads Snap sells accompany videos that are shared with a wider audience. The redesign meant to put more of the public content front and center sparked user backlash earlier this year. Offering more ways for advertisers to purchase ads has boosted revenue this year by drawing small brands looking for cheap commercial time.  But the change has made it more difficult for Snapchat to distinguish itself from other video-heavy apps and draw premium prices. The company had warned revenue growth would be lower in the second quarter as selling ads in open auction lead to weaker prices, offset somewhat by showing more ads. Snap also has been challenged by competition from Facebook&rsquo;s Instagram, which has more than 1 billion users and now many of the same features as Snapchat. RBC financial analysts noted last month that 90 percent of ad buyers it surveyed preferred advertising on Instagram to Snapchat. Snap, which has never had a profitable quarter, went public in March 2017 with a $17 share price. The stock jumped immediately following the IPO but has lost some 50 percent since. Still, the social media company&rsquo;s valuation signals investors see potential for outsized growth, with Snap entering trading on Tuesday at nearly 10 times expected revenue, compared to 7.6 times expected revenue for Facebook shares and 7 times for Twitter. Snap has tried to focus on developed markets with strong revenue potential, in contrast to Facebook&rsquo;s strategy of tailoring its apps for emerging markets that are contributing much of its new users. Snap lost $353 million in the quarter, or 27 cents per share, more than the loss of $210.61 million, or 17 cents per share, analysts had projected. The company held its first annual shareholder meeting last week via a webcast that lasted three minutes, an unusual affair because its publicly traded shares do not carry voting power. Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel and Chief Technology Officer Bobby Murphy control the company, and they received no questions or proposals from fellow shareholders for the session.

Asked on Twitter whether Musk would continue to be CEO under such a scenario, he replied there would be &ldquo;no change.&rdquo;  Musk has been under intense pressure this year to prove he can deliver on his promise to turn his money-losing company into a profitable higher-volume manufacturer, a goal that has propped up Tesla shares and resulted in a market value higher than that of General Motors Co.   The Silicon Valley company faces a make-or-break moment in its eight-year history as a public company as competition from European automakers is poised to intensify with new electric vehicles from Audi and Jaguar, with more rivals to follow suit next year. Meanwhile, Tesla has announced plans to build a factory in Shanghai, China, and another in Europe, but details are scarce and funding unknown.  The company is still working its way out of what Musk called &ldquo;production hell&rdquo; at its home factory in Fremont, California, where a series of manufacturing challenges delayed the ramp-up of production of its new Model 3 sedan, on which the company&rsquo;s profitability rests.    Related CoverageMusk says no final decision on taking Tesla private Tesla call options jump on Musk tweet, short-sellers hurt Tesla statement on potential deal to go private Going private is one way to avoid close scrutiny by the public market as Musk and the company face those challenges. Musk has feuded publicly with regulators, critics, short sellers and reporters, and some analysts have suggested that less transparency would be welcomed by Musk. &ldquo;Musk does not want to run a public company,&rdquo; said Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, as Tesla&rsquo;s ambitious mission makes it &ldquo;difficult to accommodate investors&rsquo; quarterly expectations.&rdquo;  Musk owns nearly 20 percent of the company. He said in his letter to employees that he did not seek to expand his ownership.  A price of $420 per share price would represent a nearly 23 percent premium to Tesla&rsquo;s closing price on Monday, which gave the company a market value of about $58 billion.  &ldquo;Our guess is there is a one-in-three chance he can actually pull this off and bring Tesla private,&rdquo; Munster said. &ldquo;The 16 percent premium to the current share price may not be high enough to incentivize existing shareholders to support the sale.&rdquo;  Musk tweeted that he hoped all current investors would remain were the company to go private. He made no mention in his tweets or his letter of where the funding for a deal would come from.  BIGGEST GO-PRIVATE DEAL  If Musk succeed in taking Tesla private, it would be the largest leveraged buyout of all time, beating the record set by the $45 billion deal for Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings, which ended in bankruptcy in 2014. Raising both the debt and equity required for such a deal would be a challenge. Many major Wall Street bankers contacted by Reuters said on condition of anonymity that they were not aware of Musk&rsquo;s plans ahead of his tweets, and several expressed skepticism that a leveraged buyout of Tesla could be financed given the company&rsquo;s negative cash flow. The most obvious equity partners for Musk would be a sovereign wealth fund such as Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Public Investment Fund (PIF) or major technology investment funds such as SoftBank Group Corp&rsquo;s Vision Fund, bankers said.  Such foreign sources of capital would be subject to scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which looks closely at deals for potential national security risks.

The government in Beijing has censored online images of Winnie the Pooh after some opponents likened the bear&rsquo;s appearance to President Xi Jinping and have used Pooh as a symbol of resistance. China, the world&rsquo;s second-largest film market, also limits the number of foreign-made films allowed into the country at 34 a year.

In an interview, Salvatore Lucchese, a Venezuelan activist who was previously imprisoned for his role in past protests, told Reuters he orchestrated the attack with a loose association of anti-Maduro militants known generally in Venezuela as the &ldquo;resistance.&rdquo; The &ldquo;resistance&rdquo; referred to by Lucchese is a diffuse collection of street activists, student organizers and former military officers. It has little formal structure, but is known in the country mostly for organizing protests in recent years in which demonstrators have clashed with police and soldiers. Reuters could not independently verify Lucchese&rsquo;s claims about the attack, in which drones flew over the rally in central Caracas. Explosives aboard the drones detonated, injuring seven military officers and sending attendees scurrying for cover. Lucchese described the incident as part of a sustained, armed effort against Maduro. He\u00a0declined to describe his precise role in the operation, in the broader resistance or identify others involved, citing the need to protect their identity. &ldquo;We had an objective and in the moment we were not able to materialize it 100 percent,&rdquo; Lucchese said in an interview in Bogota, where he is traveling because of activities with other opposition figures. &ldquo;The armed struggle will continue.&rdquo; Venezuela&rsquo;s Information Ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Earlier this year, Lucchese parted ways with Popular Will, a prominent opposition party, saying he disagreed with its continued dialogue with Maduro&rsquo;s administration. The government is widely criticized for authoritarian tactics, human rights abuses and economic policies that have led to recession and malnutrition across the formerly prosperous Andean nation. Juan Guaido, one of Popular Will&rsquo;s national leaders, said Lucchese was expelled for &ldquo;differences with the party and the national leadership&rdquo; but did not elaborate further. Guaido also told Reuters Popular Will rejects the use of violence, a position echoed by other mainstream opposition parties in the wake of the attack. Maduro, who was chosen by late leftist President Hugo Chavez as the Socialist Party candidate to succeed him in 2013, often says Venezuela&rsquo;s problems are the result of an &ldquo;economic war&rdquo; by enemies abroad, including the United States. He blamed the drone attack on right-wing opposition figures and foreign enablers, specifically citing the government of neighboring Colombia. Colombia&rsquo;s government has denied any involvement. Venezuelan authorities over the weekend arrested six people, including one suspect who had been detained for protests in 2014 and another wanted for involvement in a 2017 military base attack. The government said the drones carried plastic explosives detonated remotely. Saturday&rsquo;s blasts, which shook television footage from the rally and rattled nearby buildings, differed from previous suggestions by Maduro&rsquo;s government of pending attacks against it. Maduro and top aides have spoken of foiled assassination and coup plots in the past, but provided little evidence for them.  Now, it remains unclear exactly how organized or equipped armed opponents may be. A little-known group called the National Movement of Soldiers in T-Shirts over the weekend also claimed responsibility for the drone attack. It, too, describes itself as part of the &ldquo;resistance.&rdquo; Lucchese declined to say whether he is associated with Soldiers in T-Shirts. A member of the group, who declined to be identified by name, in an exchange with Reuters via a messaging platform declined to comment on Lucchese. The 52-year-old activist first drew attention after being jailed for ten months starting in 2014 for refusing to break up anti-Maduro protests. As police chief of the municipality of San Diego, in central Carabobo state, he disobeyed Interior Ministry orders to clear demonstrators, Lucchese said. His account of the arrest and jail sentence is supported by a ruling on his conviction published by Venezuela&rsquo;s Supreme Court at the time.  The government released Lucchese at the end of his sentence in February 2015, according to Lucchese and local media reports. Reuters could not find government documentation of his release. Lucchese told Reuters he left Venezuela for an undisclosed location last August, after learning the government sought his arrest once more, this time for treason and inciting military rebellion. The warrant was widely reported by Venezuelan media in recent months, but Reuters was unable to review a copy of it. Lucchese said he now resides abroad and continues to work with other anti-Maduro activists, stressing that armed resistance is the only way to topple Maduro. &ldquo;No dictator leaves power peacefully,&rdquo; he told Reuters.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     "},"6fe77af7db1b36ff5529e1d4b8b1371f":{"title":"Former city police chief claims role in Venezuela drone attack","text":"BOGOTA\/CARACAS (Reuters) - A former Venezuelan municipal police chief and anti-government activist says he helped organize an operation to launch armed drones over a military rally on Saturday that President Nicolas Maduro has called an assassination attempt.

(Reuters) - Political consultant Paul Manafort&rsquo;s protege acknowledged writing a fraudulent letter to prospective investors and using business expenses on an extramarital affair as Manafort&rsquo;s trial defense lawyer on Tuesday attacked the credibility of the star witness against the former Trump campaign chairman. Rick Gates, who is cooperating with U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, testified under questioning by lawyer Kevin Downing that he provided false information to investigators before he pleaded guilty to charges in February. &ldquo;Have they confronted you with so many lies that you can&rsquo;t remember?&rdquo; Downing asked Gates, who also worked on Republican candidate Donald Trump&rsquo;s campaign. Undercutting Gates&rsquo; credibility is the foundation of  Manafort&rsquo;s defense. Manafort, 69, has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank fraud, tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts containing tens of millions of dollars earned from work for Russian-backed politicians in Ukraine. The charges in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, largely pre-date the five months Manafort spent on Trump&rsquo;s campaign. On Monday and earlier Tuesday, Gates testified that he and Manafort had engaged in numerous improper financial maneuvers involving their work in Ukraine, but Gates, 46, pinned the majority of the responsibility on Manafort. When it was his turn for questioning, Downing accused Gates of having a &ldquo;separate, secret life&rdquo; with his lover in London and of using business expenses to pay for the affair, including an apartment in the British capital. &ldquo;There is a period of time over 10 years ago when I had a relationship, yes,&rdquo; Gates said. He also acknowledged writing a fraudulent letter to prospective investors in connection with a movie project involving a person by the name of Steve Brown. &ldquo;You committed fraud with Mr. Brown as a favor?&rdquo; Downing asked him. Gates replied: &ldquo;I did. I admit to that.&rdquo; Manafort&rsquo;s trial is the first on charges brought by Mueller&rsquo;s office. While outside the scope of the trial, Mueller is also investigating whether Trump campaign members coordinated with Russian officials, an allegation President Donald Trump denies. Related CoverageEx-Manafort aide Gates admits he had an affair in London 10 years ago Gates pleaded guilty to lying to investigators and conspiring to defraud the United States. Questioned by prosecutors earlier on Tuesday, Gates testified that Manafort instructed him not to tell their firm&rsquo;s bookkeeper about payments from accounts in Cyprus that held millions of dollars in earnings from  consulting work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. There were hundreds of emails showing Manafort approved payments out of the Cypriot accounts, he said. Gates&rsquo; testimony was part of the prosecution&rsquo;s effort to prove that Manafort was responsible for financial maneuverings that he and other witnesses have testified include filing false tax returns and failing to report foreign bank accounts. One part of Gates&rsquo; testimony led to some laughter in the courtroom.   &ldquo;Not happy. I just saw this. WTF,&rdquo; Manafort wrote to Gates in an email entered into evidence showing Manafort&rsquo;s reaction when he learned how much money he would have to pay in 2014 taxes. Gates said that he helped create documents to convert some income to a loan to lower Manafort&rsquo;s tax bill. &ldquo;You created a loan agreement for a loan that didn&rsquo;t exist?&rdquo; prosecutor Greg Andres asked him. &ldquo;Yes, we did,&rdquo; he replied. He testified about a complex scheme in which earnings from Manafort&rsquo;s political work in Ukraine would be paid by Ukrainian businessmen using companies in Cyprus to other Cyprus-based companies controlled by Manafort. Prosecutors showed contracts laying out that Manafort would be paid $4 million a year in quarterly installments of $1 million, all channeled through Cyprus. The funds were logged as loans in order to meet later audits in Cyprus that required documentation of transfers between bank accounts, but Gates testified they were in fact compensation to Manafort. &ldquo;A lot of these loan agreements are backdated,&rdquo; Gates said. Money from the Ukraine work dried up after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was forced from power in 2014, Gates testified. A $1 million payment for work in 2014 was &ldquo;significantly past due&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Manafort was quite upset the money had not been sent,&rdquo; Gates told the court. Manafort&rsquo;s Kiev-based aide Konstantin Kilimnik was able to collect $500,000, Gates said, but &ldquo;to my knowledge it was never paid in full.&rdquo; Kilimnik was indicted in the Mueller investigation in June.  "},"f1334db49939a302e87d1401deb9425e":{"title":"Snap beats on revenue, loses users for the first time","text":"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Snap Inc shares soared more than 12 percent after hours on Tuesday as the company reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and adjusted earnings even as daily users fell for the first time in its reporting history. Snap has been working to convince big advertisers to spend more of their budgets on Snapchat ads and reach the app&rsquo;s base of mainly 18-34-year-old users, and it beat analyst revenue forecasts as it drew in more international and small business advertisers.  Snap also has been redesigning the app to encourage users to interact with more of its ad-supported videos. Chief Executive Evan Spiegel said in prepared remarks that the redesign was the primary reason for usage slipping, but he credited the changes for increasing viewership of key ad-supported content this year.  &ldquo;We believe that this is an important evolution of our product that will help drive future growth in engagement,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Our users continue to spend an average of over 30 minutes on Snapchat on a daily basis.&rdquo; Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal separately announced on Tuesday that he finalized a deal in May to acquire a 2.3 percent stake in Snap by buying shares for an average price of $11.  Daily users fell to 188 million from 191 million in the prior quarter, which could heighten investor anxiety about how competition and privacy issues are affecting Snap and its peers. Snap had never before logged a quarterly drop in users, according to data it has released going back to 2014. Analysts on average expected Snap to gain nearly 2 million users in the second quarter from the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S.  The company said it set a record for monthly users but did not disclose the figure. Snap&rsquo;s user growth has pulled back sharply over the past two years. Much larger rival Facebook Inc has replicated Snapchat features such as virtual animal ear filters for selfies and the &ldquo;stories&rdquo; format for sharing content. A Snapchat redesign in February aimed at encouraging users to watch more videos prompted user protests after they found it more difficult to find the content they wanted. Snap in first-quarter results said it would again adjust how it presents content.  Earnings from Facebook and Twitter Inc in recent weeks spooked social media investors by showing issues around data privacy, abusive content and phony accounts were weighing on user growth and sending expenses higher. Both companies shed some 19 percent in market value after reporting, and the results also weighed on Snap shares. Snap lost about 1 million users in each of its three geographic reporting regions: North America, Europe and rest of world. Its revenue was $262 million in the second quarter, beating the average estimate of $250.43 million, as average revenue per user surged to $1.40 from $1.05 a year ago.  Snapchat is popular for private messaging, but most of the ads Snap sells accompany videos that are shared with a wider audience. The redesign meant to put more of the public content front and center sparked user backlash earlier this year. Offering more ways for advertisers to purchase ads has boosted revenue this year by drawing small brands looking for cheap commercial time.  But the change has made it more difficult for Snapchat to distinguish itself from other video-heavy apps and draw premium prices. The company had warned revenue growth would be lower in the second quarter as selling ads in open auction lead to weaker prices, offset somewhat by showing more ads. Snap also has been challenged by competition from Facebook&rsquo;s Instagram, which has more than 1 billion users and now many of the same features as Snapchat. Snap, which has never had a profitable quarter, went public in March 2017 with a $17 share price. The stock jumped immediately following the IPO but has lost some 50 percent since. Still, the social media company&rsquo;s valuation signals investors see potential for outsized growth, with Snap entering trading on Tuesday at nearly 10 times expected revenue, compared to 7.6 times expected revenue for Facebook shares and 7 times for Twitter. Snap has tried to focus on developed markets with strong revenue potential, in contrast to Facebook&rsquo;s strategy of tailoring its apps for emerging markets that are contributing much of its new users. Snap lost $353 million in the quarter, or 27 cents per share.

The Saudi government on Sunday recalled its ambassador to Ottawa, barred Canada&rsquo;s envoy from returning and placed a ban on new trade, denouncing Canada for urging the release of jailed rights activists. Riyadh accused Ottawa on Tuesday of interfering in its internal affairs. One well placed source said the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau - which stresses the importance of human rights - planned to reach out to the United Arab Emirates. &ldquo;The key is to work with allies and friends in the region to cool things down, which can happen quickly,&rdquo; said the source, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. Another source said Canada would also seek help from Britain. The British government on Tuesday urged the two nations to show restraint. The United States, traditionally one of Canada&rsquo;s most important friends, stayed on the sidelines. U.S. President Donald Trump - who criticized Trudeau after a Group of Seven summit in June - has forged tighter ties with Riyadh. &ldquo;Both sides need to diplomatically solve this together. We can&rsquo;t do it for them; they need to resolve it together,&rdquo; U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told a briefing. The first Canadian source said Ottawa shared the view of foreign policy experts who believe the Saudi reaction reflected internal strains inside the kingdom, where 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is trying to push through domestic reforms.  The office of Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland did not respond to requests for comment. The dispute looks set to damage what is a modest bilateral trade relationship worth nearly $4 billion a year. Canadian exports to Saudi Arabia totaled about $1.12 billion in 2017, or 0.2 percent of the total value of Canadian exports.  Canada says it does not know what will happen to a $13 billion defense contract to sell Canadian-made General Dynamics Corp armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia. European traders said the main Saudi wheat-buying agency had told grains exporters it will no longer accept Canadian-origin wheat and barley. Saudi Arabia has also ordered roughly 15,000 Saudis studying in Canada to leave.  Canada&rsquo;s previous Conservative government, which lost power to the Liberals in 2015, also had challenges with Riyadh over human rights. Thomas Juneau, an assistant professor and Middle East expert at the University of Ottawa, said Saudi irritation at the way the General Dynamics contract was handled also helped explain Riyadh&rsquo;s response. The deal was agreed in 2014 by the Conservatives, who shared the Saudi desire for deeper relations, he said. But the task of approving the export permits fell to the Liberals, who were lobbied by human rights activists to say no. The Liberals granted the permits but showed little interest in deepening ties with Riyadh amid growing civil society and media attacks on the agreement, Juneau added. &ldquo;That for Saudi Arabia was the source of growing frustration,&rdquo; he said in a phone interview. &ldquo;(The ambassador) was very clear in saying he was irritated by what he saw as passivity by the Canadian government, which in his view was not resisting that criticism.&rdquo; The first Canadian source said Ottawa had no regrets about speaking out on human rights in Saudi Arabia. Canada&rsquo;s ambassador, Dennis Horak, is not in Riyadh. The source said Saudi authorities were aware Horak was due to start a new posting next month.

European traders said the main Saudi wheat-buying agency had told grains exporters it will no longer accept Canadian-origin wheat and barley. Saudi Arabia has also ordered roughly 15,000 Saudis studying in Canada to leave.  Canada&rsquo;s previous Conservative government, which lost power to the Liberals in 2015, also had challenges with Riyadh over human rights. Thomas Juneau, an assistant professor and Middle East expert at the University of Ottawa, said Saudi irritation at the way the General Dynamics contract was handled also helped explain Riyadh&rsquo;s response. The deal was agreed in 2014 by the Conservatives, who shared the Saudi desire for deeper relations, he said. But the task of approving the export permits fell to the Liberals, who were lobbied by human rights activists to say no. The Liberals granted the permits but showed little interest in deepening ties with Riyadh amid growing civil society and media attacks on the agreement, Juneau added. &ldquo;That for Saudi Arabia was the source of growing frustration,&rdquo; he said in a phone interview. &ldquo;(The ambassador) was very clear in saying he was irritated by what he saw as passivity by the Canadian government, which in his view was not resisting that criticism.&rdquo; The first Canadian source said Ottawa had no regrets about speaking out on human rights in Saudi Arabia. Canada&rsquo;s ambassador, Dennis Horak, is not in Riyadh. The source said Saudi authorities were aware Horak was due to start a new posting next month.

Groundskeeper Dewayne Johnson is one of more than 5,000 plaintiffs across the United States who claim Monsanto&rsquo;s glyphosate-containing herbicides, including the widely-used Roundup, cause cancer. His case, the first to go to trial, began in San Francisco&rsquo;s Superior Court of California four weeks ago.  Johnson&rsquo;s lawyer Brent Wisner on Tuesday urged jurors to hold Monsanto liable and punish them with a verdict he said would &ldquo;actually change the world.&rdquo; Wisner claimed Monsanto knew about glyphosate&rsquo;s cancer risk, but decided to bury the information. Slideshow (3 Images)  Monsanto, a unit of Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE ) following a $62.5 billion acquisition by the German conglomerate, denies the allegations and says expert testimony on which Johnson and others rely does not satisfy any scientific or legal requirements.  &ldquo;The message of 40 years of scientific studies is clear: this cancer is not caused by glyphosate,&rdquo; Monsanto&rsquo;s lawyer George Lombardi said, according to an online broadcast of the trial by Courtroom View Network. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in September 2017 concluded a decades-long assessment of glyphosate risks and found the chemical not likely carcinogenic to humans. The World Health Organization&rsquo;s cancer arm in 2015 classified glyphosate as &ldquo;probably carcinogenic to humans.&rdquo;  If it finds Monsanto liable, the jury can decide to award punitive damages on top of the more than $39 million in compensatory damages Johnson demanded. The jury is expected to start deliberating on Wednesday. Johnson&rsquo;s case, filed in 2016, was fast-tracked for trial due to the severe state of his non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system that he alleges was caused by Roundup and Ranger Pro, another Monsanto glyphosate herbicide. Johnson&rsquo;s doctors said he is unlikely to live past 2020. A former pest control manager for a California county school system, Johnson, 46, applied the weed killer up to 30 times per year.  His case is not part of proceedings consolidated in Missouri, Delaware or California state court, where most of the Monsanto cases are pending. It is also separate from consolidated federal multidistrict litigation pending before U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco. Chhabria in July allowed hundreds of Roundup lawsuits to proceed to trial, finding there was sufficient evidence for a jury to hear the cases despite calling plaintiff&rsquo;s expert opinions &ldquo;shaky.&rdquo; "},"0b2834dc985521919d8c05492446d795":{"title":"Puerto Rico bankruptcy judge upholds oversight board powers over government","text":"SAN JUAN (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday that Puerto Rico&rsquo;s federal oversight board has the power to enforce fiscal discipline on the bankrupt island&rsquo;s government through the budgetary process, but lacks authority to demand changes in law. Governor Ricardo Rossello and Puerto Rico&rsquo;s legislature filed lawsuits in July claiming the board, which was created by the U.S. Congress under the so-called PROMESA Act in 2016, overstepped its power by imposing a belt-tightening fiscal plan and budget on the government that require public policy actions. The board, which sought to dismiss the litigation, argued that if it cannot impose reforms through a fiscal plan over the objections of the governor, &ldquo;then PROMESA created a toothless oversight board.&rdquo; Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled the PROMESA Act gives the board the power to make &ldquo;binding policy choices&rdquo; for the U.S. commonwealth despite the governor&rsquo;s objection.  However, when it comes to policy measures dependent on the adoption of new laws or the modification or repeal of existing laws, the board &ldquo;has only budgetary tools and negotiations to use to elicit any necessary buy-in from the elected officials and legislators,&rdquo; the ruling stated. While the ruling empowered the board in fiscal matters, it also noted that only the Puerto Rico government can pass laws necessary to implement new fiscal policies. Swain noted that the PROMESA Act is &ldquo;an awkward power-sharing arrangement&rdquo; because Puerto Rico officials have the ability &ldquo;to obstruct implementation altogether or complicate it in such a way as to cripple Puerto Rico&rsquo;s ability to use it to promote the needed return to fiscal responsibility and access to capital markets.&rdquo; With Puerto Rico sinking under roughly $120 billion in debt and pension liabilities, the board in May 2017 sought a form of bankruptcy restructuring in U.S. court. Rossello blasted the ruling for giving &ldquo;total budgetary authority to the unelected members of the oversight board, which supersede that of the elected officials of the Government of Puerto Rico and its legislature.&rdquo;  &ldquo;While we analyze the possibility of appealing the court&rsquo;s decision, we will keep looking for ways to work with the oversight board so that we avoid harsh, draconian measures that would be detrimental to our people,&rdquo; he said in a statement. The oversight board said the ruling upholds its authority and urged the Puerto Rico government to fully implement the fiscal plans and budgets it certified. &ldquo;There can be no doubt that the fiscal year 2019 budget certified by the oversight board is the only one and must be enforced,&rdquo; said Board Chairman Jos\u00e9 Carri\u00f3n in a statement. &ldquo;We call on all stakeholders to get back to work in the interests of Puerto Rico, in order to end decades of mismanagement and rebuild our island.&rdquo; While the judge dismissed several counts in the governor&rsquo;s lawsuit largely on technical grounds, she kept other parts alive, rejecting the board&rsquo;s argument that the court lacks jurisdiction over the dispute. Swain dismissed the legislators&rsquo; lawsuit in its entirety.

Many audience members cheered his remarks on Tuesday, but others interrupted to call out, &ldquo;Punishment for the guilty.&rdquo;  Some directed outrage at the governor of Ciudad Juarez&rsquo;s Chihuahua state, Javier Corral, blaming him for a spike in violence. Olga Sanchez, Lopez Obrador&rsquo;s pick for interior minister, soothed the crowd, promising economic support for victims and recognizing the depth of the crisis in the country.

Snap lost about 1 million users in each of its three geographic reporting regions: North America, Europe and rest of world. Its revenue was $262 million in the second quarter, beating the average estimate of $250.43 million, as average revenue per user surged to $1.40 from $1.05 a year ago.

Appeals court judge Kassio Marques acknowledged &ldquo;grave violations of the public and judicial order,&rdquo; but overturned the lower court&rsquo;s ruling, saying the closure would not improve humanitarian conditions for Venezuelans fleeing their country. A Foreign Ministry official said the Brazilian government  does not contemplate at all closing the border because that would violate its international commitments on human rights and a new immigration law that keeps the door open to all refugees.

Right-wing Duque, who replaces Nobel Prize winner Juan Manuel Santos, faces significant challenges.  The economy remains weak, a new wave of drug trafficking gangs have moved into areas once controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas, and nearly a million Venezuelan migrants have crossed into Colombia looking for food and work. The 42-year-old lawyer and former senator for the Democratic Center party won a decisive victory against a leftist opponent in June&rsquo;s election, promising to make adjustments to the domestically-controversial peace accord with the FARC, cut corporate taxes and redouble security efforts in certain areas. &ldquo;I want to govern Colombia with unbreakable values and principles, overcoming left and right divisions,&rdquo; Duque said in an address before dignitaries, after receiving the presidential sash in Bogota&rsquo;s Plaza Bolivar.  &ldquo;I want to govern Colombia with the spirit of building, never of destroying.&rdquo;  Colombia's new President Ivan Duque (L) addresses the audience during his swearing-in ceremony at  Bolivar Square in Bogota, Colombia August 7, 2018.

He said he will also send an anti-corruption bill to Congress and launch measures to reactivate the sluggish economy.  Duque is a protege of hardline ex-President Alvaro Uribe, a harsh critic of the peace agreement, whose father was killed by rebels.  Uribe, facing allegations of witness tampering and bribery that he has denied, is seen by many as the power behind the relatively inexperienced Duque.  But Duque, a father of three who worked at the Inter-American Development Bank before Uribe asked him to take a Senate seat in 2014, has already shown independence in some cabinet picks and in a softening of his anti-accord rhetoric.  The 2016 peace deal brought an end to the FARC&rsquo;s part in more than five decades of war which killed some 260,000, and saw thousands of rebels demobilize in return for amnesty. And though its leadership will be tried for war crimes, Duque is angry they will not serve jail time before taking up 10 guaranteed congressional seats.

Duque can count on continued support from the United States, said Nikki Haley, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, in Bogota. &ldquo;He very much sees the fact that the peace process, while it happened and was historic, wasn&rsquo;t perfect and so now it needs to be tweaked a bit,&rdquo; she told journalists. The prematurely gray-haired Duque has also said he plans to cut taxes and raise revenue from an evasion crackdown. He wants to relax the so-called fiscal rule, which obliges the government to reduce the budget deficit. &ldquo;In economic matters, mistakes have been made that we must never again repeat,&rdquo; said Duque. &ldquo;A tax policy motivated by the expansion of spending has led us to having asphyxiating burdens that affect savings, investment, job formalization and productivity.&rdquo;  With Colombia&rsquo;s debt rated BBB- by S&P and BBB by Fitch, Duque will have a hard time satisfying credit rating agencies unless he is able to replace revenue lost from weaker international oil prices.

(Reuters) - The star witness in the trial against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort faced tough questioning on cross-examination on Tuesday about a &ldquo;secret life&rdquo; that included an extramarital affair and stealing funds from his former boss.  Rick Gates, who served as a right-hand man to Manafort in his political consulting business for a decade, acknowledged maintaining a flat in London for the affair, inflating expense reports and a long list of other misdeeds.   &ldquo;In essence, I was living beyond my means,&rdquo; Gates testified. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking responsibility for it. I made a mistake.&rdquo; Gates, who is cooperating with U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, testified on Monday that he helped Manafort doctor financial statements, hide foreign income and evade hundreds of thousands of dollars in U.S. income taxes. Under questioning by defense attorney Kevin Downing on Tuesday, Gates acknowledged writing a fraudulent letter to prospective investors in a movie project and possibly submitting personal expenses to Trump&rsquo;s inaugural committee for reimbursement. Gates also worked on the campaign. Downing sought to portray Gates as an inveterate liar, raising questions about whether he has been truthful with Mueller even when he cut a plea deal in February in which he admitted to lying to investigators and conspiring to defraud the United States.  &ldquo;After all the lies you told you expect this jury to believe you?&rdquo; Downing asked Gates, who responded that he did. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to tell the truth,&rdquo; Gates shot back. &ldquo;Mr. Manafort had the same path. I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; Undercutting Gates&rsquo; credibility is the foundation of Manafort&rsquo;s defense. Manafort, 69, has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank fraud, tax fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts containing tens of millions of dollars earned from work for Russian-backed politicians in Ukraine. The charges in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, largely predate the five months Manafort spent on Trump&rsquo;s campaign. On Monday and earlier Tuesday, Gates testified that he and Manafort had engaged in numerous improper financial maneuvers involving their work in Ukraine, but Gates, 46, pinned the responsibility on Manafort. When it was his turn for questioning, Downing accused Gates of having a &ldquo;separate, secret life&rdquo; with his lover in London and of using business expenses to pay for the affair, including an apartment in the British capital. &ldquo;There is a period of time over 10 years ago when I had a relationship, yes,&rdquo; Gates said. He also acknowledged writing a fraudulent letter to prospective investors for a movie project involving Steve Brown, a business associate. Related CoverageEx-Manafort aide Gates admits he had an affair in London 10 years ago &ldquo;You committed fraud with Mr. Brown as a favor?&rdquo; Downing asked him. Gates replied: &ldquo;I did. I admit to that.&rdquo; Manafort&rsquo;s trial is the first on charges brought by Mueller&rsquo;s office. While outside the scope of the trial, Mueller is also investigating whether Trump campaign members coordinated with Russian officials, an allegation President Donald Trump denies. Gates pleaded guilty to lying to investigators and conspiring to defraud the United States. Questioned by prosecutors earlier on Tuesday, Gates testified that Manafort instructed him not to tell their firm&rsquo;s bookkeeper about payments from accounts in Cyprus that held millions of dollars in earnings from consulting work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. There were hundreds of emails showing Manafort approved payments out of the Cypriot accounts, he said. Gates&rsquo; testimony was part of the prosecution&rsquo;s effort to prove that Manafort was responsible for financial maneuverings that he and other witnesses have testified include filing false tax returns and failing to report foreign bank accounts. One part of Gates&rsquo; testimony led to some laughter in the courtroom.   &ldquo;Not happy. I just saw this. WTF,&rdquo; Manafort wrote to Gates in an email entered into evidence showing Manafort&rsquo;s reaction when he learned how much money he would have to pay in 2014 taxes. Gates said that he helped create documents to convert some income to a loan to lower Manafort&rsquo;s tax bill. &ldquo;You created a loan agreement for a loan that didn&rsquo;t exist?&rdquo; prosecutor Greg Andres asked him. &ldquo;Yes, we did,&rdquo; he replied. He testified about a complex scheme in which earnings from Manafort&rsquo;s political work in Ukraine would be paid by Ukrainian businessmen using companies in Cyprus to other Cyprus-based companies controlled by Manafort. Prosecutors showed contracts laying out that Manafort would be paid $4 million a year in quarterly installments of $1 million, all channeled through Cyprus. The funds were logged as loans in order to meet later audits in Cyprus that required documentation of transfers between bank accounts, but Gates testified they were in fact compensation to Manafort. &ldquo;A lot of these loan agreements are backdated,&rdquo; Gates said. Money from the Ukraine work dried up after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was forced from power in 2014, Gates testified. A $1 million payment for work in 2014 was &ldquo;significantly past due&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Manafort was quite upset the money had not been sent,&rdquo; Gates told the court. Manafort&rsquo;s Kiev-based aide Konstantin Kilimnik was able to collect $500,000, Gates said, but &ldquo;to my knowledge it was never paid in full.&rdquo; Kilimnik was indicted in the Mueller investigation in June.

Funding secured,\" Musk said on Twitter bit.ly\/2Om3gn3. At $420 per share, a deal would be worth $72 billion overall.  In a letter to Tesla employees published more than an hour later on the company's blog here, Musk explained that going private would be \"the best path forward.\" Such a move - over which no final decision had been made - would let Tesla \"operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible,\" he wrote. Tesla shares closed up 11 percent at $379.57, slightly below their all-time high. Asked on Twitter whether Musk would continue to be CEO under such a scenario, he replied there would be &ldquo;no change.&rdquo;  Musk has been under intense pressure this year to turn his money-losing, debt-laden company into a profitable higher-volume manufacturer, a prospect that has sent Tesla&rsquo;s valuation higher than that of General Motors Co.   The company is still working its way out of what Musk called &ldquo;production hell&rdquo; at its home factory in Fremont, California, where a series of manufacturing challenges delayed the ramp-up of production of its new Model 3 sedan, on which the company&rsquo;s profitability rests.    The Silicon Valley company faces a make-or-break moment in its eight-year history as a public company as competition from European automakers is poised to intensify with new electric vehicles from Audi and Jaguar, with more rivals to follow suit next year. Meanwhile, Tesla has announced plans to build a factory in Shanghai, China, and another in Europe, but details are scarce and funding unknown.  Going private is one way to avoid close scrutiny by the public market as Musk and the company face those challenges. Musk has feuded publicly with regulators, critics, short sellers and reporters, and some analysts suggested that less transparency would be welcomed by Musk. Related CoverageTesla call options soar on Musk tweet, short-sellers hit Musk plan to privatize Tesla pushes $2.3 billion of debt above conversion price Tesla statement on potential deal to go private &ldquo;Musk does not want to run a public company,&rdquo; said Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, as Tesla&rsquo;s ambitious mission makes it &ldquo;difficult to accommodate investors&rsquo; quarterly expectations.&rdquo;  Musk owns nearly 20 percent of the company. He said in his letter to employees he did not seek to expand his ownership.  A price of $420 per share would represent a nearly 23 percent premium to Tesla&rsquo;s closing price on Monday, which gave the company a market value of about $58 billion.  In his letter, Musk suggested a choice for shareholders of selling their shares for $420 each or remaining investors in a private Tesla. He said he hoped all current investors would remain were the company to go private. He made no mention in his tweets nor his letter where the funding for a deal would come from, and the letter did not discuss funding for the plan. Like any other investor, Musk is beholden to securities laws and several securities attorneys told Reuters he potentially could face lawsuits if it was proven he did not have secure financing at the time of his tweet.  (GRAPHIC-Market value of Tesla, Ford, GM: tmsnrt.rs\/2n4mFjh) BIGGEST GO-PRIVATE DEAL  If Musk were to succeed in taking Tesla private, it would be the largest leveraged buyout of all time, beating the record set by the $45 billion deal for Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings, which ended in bankruptcy in 2014. Raising both the debt and equity required for such a deal would be a challenge. Many major Wall Street bankers contacted by Reuters said on condition of anonymity they were not aware of Musk&rsquo;s plans ahead of his tweets, and several expressed skepticism that a leveraged buyout of Tesla could be financed given the company&rsquo;s negative cash flow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfathomable to me that anyone would finance the acquisition of such a liability-laden company that is losing so much money and have massive capex requirements going forward,&rdquo; said Mark Spiegel, portfolio manager of hedge fund Stanphyl Capital Partners, who holds a short position in Tesla and has been a vocal critic of Musk on Twitter. The most obvious equity partners for Musk would be a sovereign wealth fund such as Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Public Investment Fund (PIF) or major technology investment funds such as SoftBank Group Corp&rsquo;s Vision Fund, bankers said.  China&rsquo;s Tencent Holdings, which took a 5 percent stake in Tesla last year, is another possible partner. Such foreign sources of capital would be subject to scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which looks closely at deals for potential national security risks. Earlier on Tuesday, a source familiar with the matter said Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s PIF had bought a minority stake of just below 5 percent in Tesla. UNORTHODOX ANNOUNCEMENT The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on Musk&rsquo;s tweet, but the agency allows companies to use social media outlets like Twitter to announce key information in compliance with its fair disclosure rules if investors are alerted about which social media outlets will be used.

Funding secured,\" Musk said on Twitter bit.ly\/2Om3gn3. At $420 per share, a deal would be worth $72 billion overall.  In a letter to Tesla employees published more than an hour later on the company's blog here, Musk explained that going private would be \"the best path forward.\" Such a move - over which no final decision had been made - would let Tesla \"operate at its best, free from as much distraction and short-term thinking as possible,\" he wrote. Tesla shares closed up 11 percent at $379.57, slightly below their all-time high. Asked on Twitter whether Musk would continue to be CEO under such a scenario, he replied there would be &ldquo;no change.&rdquo;  Musk has been under intense pressure this year to turn his money-losing, debt-laden company into a profitable higher-volume manufacturer, a prospect that has sent Tesla&rsquo;s valuation higher than that of General Motors Co.   The company is still working its way out of what Musk called &ldquo;production hell&rdquo; at its home factory in Fremont, California, where a series of manufacturing challenges delayed the ramp-up of production of its new Model 3 sedan, on which the company&rsquo;s profitability rests.    The Silicon Valley company faces a make-or-break moment in its eight-year history as a public company as competition from European automakers is poised to intensify with new electric vehicles from Audi and Jaguar, with more rivals to follow suit next year. Meanwhile, Tesla has announced plans to build a factory in Shanghai, China, and another in Europe, but details are scarce and funding unknown.  Going private is one way to avoid close scrutiny by the public market as Musk and the company face those challenges. Musk has feuded publicly with regulators, critics, short sellers and reporters, and some analysts suggested that less transparency would be welcomed by Musk. Related CoverageTesla call options soar on Musk tweet, short-sellers hit Musk plan to privatize Tesla pushes $2.3 billion of debt above conversion price Tesla statement on potential deal to go private &ldquo;Musk does not want to run a public company,&rdquo; said Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, as Tesla&rsquo;s ambitious mission makes it &ldquo;difficult to accommodate investors&rsquo; quarterly expectations.&rdquo;  Musk owns nearly 20 percent of the company. He said in his letter to employees he did not seek to expand his ownership.  A price of $420 per share would represent a nearly 23 percent premium to Tesla&rsquo;s closing price on Monday, which gave the company a market value of about $58 billion.  In his letter, Musk suggested a choice for shareholders of selling their shares for $420 each or remaining investors in a private Tesla. He said he hoped all current investors would remain were the company to go private. He made no mention in his tweets nor his letter where the funding for a deal would come from, and the letter did not discuss funding for the plan. Like any other investor, Musk is beholden to securities laws and several securities attorneys told Reuters he potentially could face lawsuits if it was proven he did not have secure financing at the time of his tweet.  (GRAPHIC-Market value of Tesla, Ford, GM: tmsnrt.rs\/2n4mFjh) BIGGEST GO-PRIVATE DEAL  If Musk were to succeed in taking Tesla private, it would be the largest leveraged buyout of all time, beating the record set by the $45 billion deal for Texas power utility Energy Future Holdings, which ended in bankruptcy in 2014. Raising both the debt and equity required for such a deal would be a challenge. Many major Wall Street bankers contacted by Reuters said on condition of anonymity they were not aware of Musk&rsquo;s plans ahead of his tweets, and several expressed skepticism that a leveraged buyout of Tesla could be financed given the company&rsquo;s negative cash flow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfathomable to me that anyone would finance the acquisition of such a liability-laden company that is losing so much money and have massive capex requirements going forward,&rdquo; said Mark Spiegel, portfolio manager of hedge fund Stanphyl Capital Partners, who holds a short position in Tesla and has been a vocal critic of Musk on Twitter. The most obvious equity partners for Musk would be a sovereign wealth fund such as Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Public Investment Fund (PIF) or major technology investment funds such as SoftBank Group Corp&rsquo;s Vision Fund, bankers said.  China&rsquo;s Tencent Holdings, which took a 5 percent stake in Tesla last year, is another possible partner. Such foreign sources of capital would be subject to scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which looks closely at deals for potential national security risks. Earlier on Tuesday, a source familiar with the matter said Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s PIF had bought a minority stake of just below 5 percent in Tesla. UNORTHODOX ANNOUNCEMENT The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment on Musk&rsquo;s tweet, but the agency allows companies to use social media outlets like Twitter to announce key information in compliance with its fair disclosure rules if investors are alerted about which social media outlets will be used. Tesla alerted investors in a 2013 SEC filing that they should follow Musk&rsquo;s Twitter feed for &ldquo;additional information&rdquo; about the company. There is no reference to Musk&rsquo;s Twitter account on the company&rsquo;s investor relation page under &ldquo;investor communication,&rdquo; although Tesla&rsquo;s Twitter feed is included.

A monthly survey by the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) showed there was no lack of appetite for hiring among employers, as the number of vacancies grew at the fastest pace since November 2017. Britain&rsquo;s unemployment rate has tumbled to its lowest level since 1975 at 4.2 percent and many employers have reported a shortage of EU migrants available for work since the Brexit vote in June 2016. An REC spokeswoman said companies were continuing to flag the problem of fewer EU candidates for jobs in Britain. Official data has shown that the number of EU immigrants to Britain fell to a five-year low last year. The REC survey showed rising pay for newly hired permanent staff, albeit to a lesser extent than in previous months. &ldquo;With our data showing starting salaries continuing to rise, the latest official government figures suggest that we are finally seeing the effects of a tighter labor market feed through to pay,&rdquo; Sophie Wingfield, head of policy at REC, said. Employers picked up the pace of hiring of temporary workers and their pay rose too, REC said.    The Bank of England said last week it expected pay growth for the workforce as a whole to increase gradually over the next three years as Britain&rsquo;s economy operates close to full capacity. This risk of the economy overheating was why it raised borrowing costs for only the second time since the global financial crisis.

The social media company said its shift toward a self-serve model for advertisers was paying off and blamed a redesign of its app for denting user numbers. Still, analysts expressed concern that advertisers and users prefer Facebook Inc&rsquo;s Instagram app over Snapchat.       Snap picked up a big backer in Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who announced soon after the second-quarter results he had bought a 2.3 percent stake for $250 million in May. He said in a statement Snap had just begun to &ldquo;scratch the surface of its true potential.&rdquo; Shares in Snap were flat in after-hours trading following volatility that saw them fall briefly before surging more than 12 percent.  The company has shifted over the last year to primarily selling ads through self-service, automated auctions rather than direct sales. That has come at the cost of the premium feel Snap had tried to ascribe to its ads, but given overall sales a jolt by attracting more advertisers. Snap has been able to boost sales volumes by competing with bigger services on price. Prices fell 9 percent in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter and 52 percent from a year ago. &ldquo;It gives an incredible opportunity for advertisers to come and win on our platform,&rdquo; Chief Strategy Officer Imran Khan told analysts on a webcast on Tuesday.   With self-service ads, Snap has been able to grow revenue in regions such as Australia and the Middle East, where direct sales efforts are more limited and advertisers have few other options to market to its mainly 18-34-year-old users. Snap also has been redesigning its app to encourage users to interact with more of its ad-supported videos. Its global revenue was $262 million in the second quarter, beating the Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S estimate of $250.43 million, as average revenue per user surged to $1.40 from $1.05 a year ago. Snap forecast third-quarter sales of $265 million to $290 million, up 27 percent to 39 percent from a year earlier, compared with 44 percent revenue growth in the second quarter. Daily Snapchat users fell to 188 million in the second quarter from 191 million in the prior quarter. Snap had never before logged a quarterly drop in daily users, according to data it has released going back to 2014.       Snap lost about 1 million users in each of its three geographic reporting regions: North America, Europe and rest of world. Analysts on average expected Snap to gain nearly 2 million users in the second quarter from the first.  The company cautioned that usage tends to slow in the third quarter, but did not make a specific forecast. Earnings from Facebook and Twitter Inc in recent weeks spooked social media investors by showing issues around data privacy, abusive content and phony accounts were weighing on user growth. Both companies shed some 19 percent in market value after reporting. But some analysts on Tuesday brushed off Snap&rsquo;s user drop, saying that Snapchat always had more limited appeal than larger rivals.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always going to be a niche platform, so the modest change isn&rsquo;t very remarkable,&rdquo; said Pivotal Research&rsquo;s Brian Wieser. Snap executives told analysts that the redesign was the primary reason for usage slipping and that a European Union data protection law that spurred changes to user privacy terms had no material effect.

BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told a post-meeting briefing that the bank would allow long-term yields to move at double the previous range of around minus 0.1 percent to 0.1 percent. One board member, however, argued that the BOJ should allow yields to move upward and downward by around 0.25 percent, referring to recent yield moves in other major economies, the summary showed. &ldquo;Controlling the long-term yields in a flexible manner is likely to contribute to maintaining and improving market functions. Even if interest rates rise somewhat from the current level, its effects on economic activity and prices are likely to be limited,&rdquo; the board member was quoted as saying.

O&rsquo;Connor and Balderson exchanged leads as the votes rolled in, with the Democrat ahead by about one percentage point, 50 percent to 49 percent, with about 75 percent of precincts counted in the fight for a U.S. House of Representative seat. Trump visited the reliably Republican 12th Congressional District in Ohio over the weekend to try to head off an upset in the race after polls showed a tightening battle between Balderson and O&rsquo;Connor. The Ohio election was the marquee contest on a day of voting that featured primaries in four other states. Other key contests include a Democratic battle for governor in Michigan between a progressive and a mainstream candidate and a high-profile conservative challenge to the incumbent Republican governor in Kansas. The district, split between suburban Columbus, Ohio, and rural areas, has been represented by a Republican since the early 1980s. Trump carried it by 11 percentage points in the 2016 presidential race. O&rsquo;Connor has wiped out most or all of Balderson&rsquo;s lead in opinion polls, and a Democratic win would set off alarm bells for Republicans already worried by a series of strong performances in special elections by Democrats in the Trump era. &ldquo;A month ago this race was flying under the radar, but it has become nationalized and become more of a referendum on Trump, which really generates Democratic enthusiasm,&rdquo; said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute in New Jersey. A Monmouth poll last week showed the race was essentially a dead heat, down from a double-digit advantage for Balderson a month ago. In addition to more Democrats expressing high interest in the race, Murray said the shift was driven by independents unhappy with the status quo under Trump. Trump again pushed Balderson in an early morning tweet before voting began. Democrats must pick up 23 seats in the House and two seats in the U.S. Senate to gain control of those chambers and put a brake on Trump&rsquo;s agenda. All 435 House seats, 35 of 100 Senate seats and 36 of 50 governors&rsquo; offices are up for grabs in the Nov. 6 contests. Other well-known Republicans trekked to Ohio, including Vice President Mike Pence. A Republican advocacy group aired an ad featuring praise for Balderson, a state lawmaker, from Ohio Governor John Kasich, a frequent critic of Trump. Republicans have tried to paint O&rsquo;Connor, a local county official, as a liberal who would follow House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. But O&rsquo;Connor has walked a more moderate line, saying he wants new party leadership in Congress and would work with Republicans, while also criticizing the Trump tax cut. Michigan, Missouri, Kansas and Washington also hold primaries on Tuesday. The Democratic race for governor in Michigan offers the next test of the electoral power of the party&rsquo;s progressive wing, with former Detroit health director Abdul El-Sayed vying to become the country&rsquo;s first Muslim governor against a more moderate Democrat, former state Senate leader Gretchen Whitmer. Whitmer held an early lead over El-Sayed, who was endorsed by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and campaigned recently with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young democratic socialist whose New York primary upset in June made her a movement star. In Kansas, Kris Kobach, a conservative leader in the movement to restrict illegal immigration and pass more restrictive voting laws, trailed Governor Jeff Colyer in early returns for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Trump endorsed Kobach, Kansas&rsquo; secretary of state, on Monday. Kobach was an immigration adviser to Trump&rsquo;s campaign in 2016 and vice chairman of Trump&rsquo;s commission to investigate voting fraud before the panel collapsed.

Michigan, Missouri, Kansas and Washington also hold primaries on Tuesday. The Democratic race for governor in Michigan offers the next test of the electoral power of the party&rsquo;s progressive wing, with former Detroit health director Abdul El-Sayed vying to become the country&rsquo;s first Muslim governor against a more moderate Democrat, former state Senate leader Gretchen Whitmer. Whitmer held an early lead over El-Sayed, who was endorsed by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and campaigned recently with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the young democratic socialist whose New York primary upset in June made her a movement star. In Kansas, Kris Kobach, a conservative leader in the movement to restrict illegal immigration and pass more restrictive voting laws, trailed Governor Jeff Colyer in early returns for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. Trump endorsed Kobach, Kansas&rsquo; secretary of state, on Monday. Kobach was an immigration adviser to Trump&rsquo;s campaign in 2016 and vice chairman of Trump&rsquo;s commission to investigate voting fraud before the panel collapsed.

The Requesens siblings were among young   politicians who helped lead the protests.    In a televised speech on Tuesday, Maduro showed a video of a  young man detained over the drone incident saying that  Requesens had been involved. &ldquo;Another leader of the opposition is mentioned, one of the craziest ones, a psychopath, his last name is Requesens,&rdquo;  Maduro said.

In an interview, Salvatore Lucchese, a Venezuelan activist who was previously imprisoned for his role in past protests, told Reuters he orchestrated the attack with a loose association of anti-Maduro militants known generally in Venezuela as the &ldquo;resistance.&rdquo; The &ldquo;resistance&rdquo; referred to by Lucchese is a diffuse collection of street activists, student organizers and former military officers. It has little formal structure, but is known in the country mostly for organizing protests in recent years in which demonstrators have clashed with police and soldiers. Reuters could not independently verify Lucchese&rsquo;s claims about the attack, in which drones flew over the rally in central Caracas. Explosives aboard the drones detonated, injuring seven military officers and sending attendees scurrying for cover. Lucchese described the incident as part of a sustained, armed effort against Maduro. He declined to describe his precise role in the operation, in the broader resistance or identify others involved, citing the need to protect their identity. &ldquo;We had an objective and in the moment we were not able to materialize it 100 percent,&rdquo; Lucchese said in an interview in Bogota, where he is traveling because of activities with other opposition figures. &ldquo;The armed struggle will continue.&rdquo; Venezuela&rsquo;s Information Ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Earlier this year, Lucchese parted ways with Popular Will, a prominent opposition party, saying he disagreed with its continued dialogue with Maduro&rsquo;s administration. The government is widely criticized for authoritarian tactics, human rights abuses and economic policies that have led to recession and malnutrition across the formerly prosperous Andean nation. Juan Guaido, one of Popular Will&rsquo;s national leaders, said Lucchese was expelled for &ldquo;differences with the party and the national leadership&rdquo; but did not elaborate further. Guaido also told Reuters Popular Will rejects the use of violence, a position echoed by other mainstream opposition parties in the wake of the attack. Maduro, who was chosen by late leftist President Hugo Chavez as the Socialist Party candidate to succeed him in 2013, often says Venezuela&rsquo;s problems are the result of an &ldquo;economic war&rdquo; by enemies abroad, including the United States. He blamed the drone attack on right-wing opposition figures and foreign enablers, specifically citing the government of neighboring Colombia. Colombia&rsquo;s government has denied any involvement. In a televised broadcast on Tuesday night, Maduro mentioned Lucchese and linked him to Colombia&rsquo;s new right-wing president Ivan Duque. &ldquo;A former police boss of the Venezuelan right has been claiming responsibility for leading the attack. Today he was a special guest at the swearing-in of Colombia&rsquo;s incoming president,&rdquo; said Maduro. ARRESTS Venezuela&rsquo;s opposition said that lawmaker Juan Requesens and his sister Rafaela Requesens, a student leader, were arrested in their Caracas apartment on Tuesday night, following Maduro&rsquo;s vow vowed to crack down on adversaries following the drone attack. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on those alleged arrests either.    Venezuelan authorities over the weekend arrested six people, including one suspect who had been detained for protests in 2014 and another wanted for involvement in a 2017 military base attack. The government said the drones carried plastic explosives detonated remotely. Saturday&rsquo;s blasts, which shook television footage from the rally and rattled nearby buildings, differed from previous suggestions by Maduro&rsquo;s government of pending attacks against it. Maduro and top aides have spoken of foiled assassination and coup plots in the past, but provided little evidence for them. Now, it remains unclear exactly how organized or equipped armed opponents may be. A little-known group called the National Movement of Soldiers in T-Shirts over the weekend also claimed responsibility for the drone attack. It, too, describes itself as part of the &ldquo;resistance.&rdquo; Lucchese declined to say whether he is associated with Soldiers in T-Shirts. A member of the group, who declined to be identified by name, in an exchange with Reuters via a messaging platform declined to comment on Lucchese. The 52-year-old activist first drew attention after being jailed for ten months starting in 2014 for refusing to break up anti-Maduro protests. As police chief of the municipality of San Diego, in central Carabobo state, he disobeyed Interior Ministry orders to clear demonstrators, Lucchese said. His account of the arrest and jail sentence is supported by a ruling on his conviction published by Venezuela&rsquo;s Supreme Court at the time. The government released Lucchese at the end of his sentence in February 2015, according to Lucchese and local media reports. Reuters could not find government documentation of his release. Lucchese told Reuters he left Venezuela for an undisclosed location last August, after learning the government sought his arrest once more, this time for treason and inciting military rebellion. The warrant was widely reported by Venezuelan media in recent months, but Reuters was unable to review a copy of it. Lucchese said he now resides abroad and continues to work with other anti-Maduro activists, stressing that armed resistance is the only way to topple Maduro. &ldquo;No dictator leaves power peacefully,&rdquo; he told Reuters.

Imports also rose much faster in July driven by still solid domestic demand, official data showed on Wednesday. The headline numbers are the first readings of the overall trade picture for the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy since U.S duties on $34 billion of Chinese imports came into effect on July 6. China&rsquo;s closely watched surplus with the United States dipped only slightly to $28.09 billion last month from a record $28.97 billion in June. Washington has long criticized China&rsquo;s trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing cut it. Still, disagreements between the two major economic powers run deeper than just the trade balance and tensions remain over market access, intellectual property, technology transfer and investment.  The United States and China implemented tariffs on $34billion worth of each other&rsquo;s goods in July. Since then, Washington and Beijing have raised the stakes by threatening more punitive trade measures in an intensifying dispute that has rattled financial markets worried about the impact on investment and growth.  The two sides have shown no signs of letting up, with the U.S. earlier Wednesday saying it will begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods on Aug. 23, and Chinese media resorting to personal attacks against Trump earlier in the week. China&rsquo;s July exports rose 12.2 percent from a year earlier, beating forecasts for a 10 percent increase according to the latest Reuters poll, and up from a 11.2 percent gain in June. A weaker yuan, which marked its worst 4-month fall on record between April and July, may have taken the sting out of 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion exports to the United States. However, analysts still expect a less favorable trade balance for China in coming months given it&rsquo;s early days in the tariff brawl. After a strong start to the year, growth in the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy cooled slightly in the second quarter, partly hit by the government&rsquo;s years-long efforts to tackle debt risks.  The worry is that the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, rising corporate bankruptcies, and a steep decline in the value of the yuan versus the dollar could put a significant dent on the economy. The government has responded by releasing more liquidity into the banking system, encouraging lending and promising a more &ldquo;active&rdquo; fiscal policy. Imports grew 27.3 percent in July, customs said, beating analysts&rsquo; forecast of 16.2 percent growth, and compared with a 14.1 percent rise in June.

There were also divisions between those in the nine-member board who were worried about the rising demerits of prolonged easing, and those who wanted to continue focusing on reflating growth with aggressive monetary stimulus, the summary showed. The rift underscores the policy challenges the BOJ faces as subdued inflation forces the central bank to maintain its radical stimulus program despite the mounting costs such as the hit of near-zero rates on bank profits. At the July 30-31 policy meeting, the BOJ kept its pledge to guide long-term interest rates around zero percent, but said it would allow yields to move more flexibly. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda told a post-meeting briefing that the bank would allow long-term yields to move at double the previous range of around minus 0.1 percent to 0.1 percent. However, one board member said the BOJ should allow yields to move upward and downward by around 0.25 percent, referring to recent yield moves in other major economies, according to the summary, which was released on Wednesday. The summary does not identify which members made the comments. &ldquo;Controlling long-term yields in a flexible manner is likely to contribute to maintaining and improving market functions. Even if interest rates rise somewhat from the current level, its effects on economic activity and prices are likely to be limited,&rdquo; the board member was quoted as saying. Another board member warned against allowing long-term rates to rise much, saying that doing so when inflation expectations remained weak could push up real borrowing costs and weigh on price growth, the summary showed. Japanese bond yields hit a 1-1\/2 year high last week, as investors tested the limits of the BOJ&rsquo;s new commitment to allow debt markets to move more freely. Under a policy dubbed yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ guides short-term rates at minus 0.1 percent and the 10-year government bond yield around zero percent. While the central bank has successfully controlled yields around the target, its dominance shrank liquidity in the bond market to the extent there had been days in recent months when the benchmark 10-year bond was not traded at all. Concerns over the dwindling trade volume was partly behind the BOJ&rsquo;s decision last week to allow yields to rise more. There were also discussions last week on whether the BOJ should ramp up stimulus, instead of taking steps to make the current framework more sustainable, reflecting views within the board that it would take longer than expected to achieve the bank&rsquo;s 2 percent inflation target. &ldquo;It is necessary to strengthen monetary easing itself&rdquo; instead of taking steps to prepare for a long-term battle to achieve the BOJ&rsquo;s price target, one member was quoted as saying. Several members, on the other hand, called for more focus on addressing the side effects of prolonged easing. One member said the BOJ must continue to examine whether there was room to review its policy to mitigate the demerits, the summary showed. A finance ministry representative present at the meeting said the government &ldquo;welcomes&rdquo; the BOJ&rsquo;s measures, in a sign the moves had endorsement from premier Shinzo Abe&rsquo;s administration, the summary showed. But the government also saw the BOJ&rsquo;s move as a sign it will maintain its massive stimulus, another government representative said, suggesting Abe remains opposed to any attempts to dial back the bank&rsquo;s massive monetary stimulus.

Republican Troy Balderson led Democrat Danny O&rsquo;Connor by about 1,700 votes with all precincts reporting, although a final result was delayed while a few thousand provisional votes were still to be counted. The close race in the Ohio special election had become a referendum on Trump&rsquo;s leadership and a last chance to gauge Democratic strength ahead of November&rsquo;s midterm elections. The narrow margin will be little comfort for Republicans anxious about the prospect of a Democratic wave heading into the Nov. 6 elections, and is certain to encourage Democrats who performed dramatically better than expected in a district Republicans have represented since the early 1980s. The central Ohio race was the marquee contest on a day when four other states held nominating contests, including a battle for governor in Michigan in which a mainstream candidate beat a progressive, and a high-profile conservative challenge to the incumbent Republican governor in Kansas. The Ohio contest drew an avalanche of national attention in recent weeks as polls showed it tightening, with Republicans and their allies outspending Democratic groups by more than 4 to 1 and running ads linking O&rsquo;Connor to liberal House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. O&rsquo;Connor, a local county official, tried to project a moderate image, saying he would support new Democratic leadership in Congress and work with Republicans but also criticizing the Trump tax cut. Trump took credit for the apparent Republican victory, saying on Twitter that Balderson&rsquo;s campaign made &ldquo;a big turn for the better&rdquo; after he campaigned for him in the district on Saturday night. Balderson told supporters in Ohio: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to thank President Trump.&rdquo; Other Republicans had also rushed to Balderson&rsquo;s aid. Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Trump critic, endorsed Balderson and Vice President Mike Pence also visited. &lsquo;NOT STOPPING&rsquo; Trump won the district by 11 percentage points in the White House race in 2016 and Republican Pat Tiberi won re-election to the House by a whopping 37 percentage points. However, Tiberi resigned before he finished his term, forcing the special election to replace him. O&rsquo;Connor and Balderson will face off again in November to serve a full two-year term. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not stopping now. Tomorrow we rest and then we keep fighting through to November,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Connor told supporters. The district includes many of the suburban women and college-educated, affluent residents that polls show have been the sort of voters turned off by Trump&rsquo;s chaotic first 19 months in office. Democrats need to pick up 23 seats in the House and two seats in the Senate to win majorities in those chambers and put the brakes on Trump&rsquo;s agenda. All 435 House seats, 35 of 100 Senate seats and 36 of 50 governors&rsquo; offices are up for grabs in November.

Republican Troy Balderson led Democrat Danny O&rsquo;Connor by about 1,700 votes with all precincts reporting, although a final result was delayed while a few thousand provisional votes were still to be counted. The close race in the Ohio special election had become a referendum on Trump&rsquo;s leadership and a last chance to gauge Democratic strength ahead of November&rsquo;s midterm elections. The narrow margin will be little comfort for Republicans anxious about the prospect of a Democratic wave heading into the Nov. 6 elections, and is certain to encourage Democrats who performed dramatically better than expected in a district Republicans have represented since the early 1980s. The central Ohio race was the marquee contest on a day when four other states held nominating contests, including a battle for governor in Michigan in which a mainstream candidate beat a progressive, and a high-profile conservative challenge to the incumbent Republican governor in Kansas. The Ohio contest drew an avalanche of national attention in recent weeks as polls showed it tightening, with Republicans and their allies outspending Democratic groups by more than 4 to 1 and running ads linking O&rsquo;Connor to liberal House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. O&rsquo;Connor, a local county official, tried to project a moderate image, saying he would support new Democratic leadership in Congress and work with Republicans but also criticizing the Trump tax cut. Trump took credit for the apparent Republican victory, saying on Twitter that Balderson&rsquo;s campaign made &ldquo;a big turn for the better&rdquo; after he campaigned for him in the district on Saturday night. Balderson told supporters in Ohio: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to thank President Trump.&rdquo; Other Republicans had also rushed to Balderson&rsquo;s aid. Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Trump critic, endorsed Balderson and Vice President Mike Pence also visited. &lsquo;NOT STOPPING&rsquo; Trump won the district by 11 percentage points in the White House race in 2016 and Republican Pat Tiberi won re-election to the House by a whopping 37 percentage points. However, Tiberi resigned before he finished his term, forcing the special election to replace him. O&rsquo;Connor and Balderson will face off again in November to serve a full two-year term. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not stopping now. Tomorrow we rest and then we keep fighting through to November,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Connor told supporters. The district includes many of the suburban women and college-educated, affluent residents that polls show have been the sort of voters turned off by Trump&rsquo;s chaotic first 19 months in office. Democrats need to pick up 23 seats in the House and two seats in the Senate to win majorities in those chambers and put the brakes on Trump&rsquo;s agenda. All 435 House seats, 35 of 100 Senate seats and 36 of 50 governors&rsquo; offices are up for grabs in November.

Imports also rose much faster in July driven by still solid domestic demand, official data showed on Wednesday. The headline numbers are the first readings of the overall trade picture for the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy since U.S duties on $34 billion of Chinese imports came into effect on July 6. China&rsquo;s closely watched surplus with the United States dipped only slightly to $28.09 billion last month from a record $28.97 billion in June. Washington has long criticized China&rsquo;s trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing cut it. Still, disagreements between the two major economic powers run deeper than just the trade balance and tensions remain over market access, intellectual property, technology transfer and investment.  The United States and China implemented tariffs on $34billion worth of each other&rsquo;s goods in July. Since then, Washington and Beijing have raised the stakes by threatening more punitive trade measures in an intensifying dispute that has rattled financial markets worried about the impact on investment and growth.  The two sides have shown no signs of letting up, with the U.S. earlier Wednesday saying it will begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods on Aug. 23, and Chinese media resorting to personal attacks against Trump earlier in the week. China&rsquo;s July exports rose 12.2 percent from a year earlier, beating forecasts for a 10 percent increase according to the latest Reuters poll, and up from a 11.2 percent gain in June. A weaker yuan, which marked its worst 4-month fall on record between April and July, may have taken the sting out of 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion exports to the United States. However, analysts still expect a less favorable trade balance for China in coming months given it&rsquo;s early days in the tariff brawl. After a strong start to the year, growth in the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy cooled slightly in the second quarter, partly hit by the government&rsquo;s years-long efforts to tackle debt risks.  The worry is that the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, rising corporate bankruptcies, and a steep decline in the value of the yuan versus the dollar could put a significant dent on the economy. The government has responded by releasing more liquidity into the banking system, encouraging lending and promising a more &ldquo;active&rdquo; fiscal policy. Imports grew 27.3 percent in July, customs said, beating analysts&rsquo; forecast of 16.2 percent growth, and compared with a 14.1 percent rise in June.

Crude shipments came in at 36.02 million tonnes last month, or 8.48 million barrels per day, up from 8.18 million bpd a year ago, and just up on June&rsquo;s 8.36 million bpd, data from the General Administration of Customs showed.  However, July imports were still the third lowest so far this year.  The slight pick-up likely reflected some teapot plants returning from maintenance, while refining margins also improved thanks to higher domestic fuel prices, said James Gao of consultancy China Sublime Information Group. But overall, independent plants were under pressure from thinning margins since March following a new government tax regulation and near four-year high oil prices, with one plant having already declared bankruptcy.   Independent refiner Shandong Haiyou Petrochemical Group filed for bankruptcy in late July and its crude processing units have been shut indefinitely. State-owned refineries, however, are maintaining robust refining margins as they dominate the retail market and also have fuel export quotas, and as competition from teapots is waning. China&rsquo;s largest refiner Sinopec Corp (0386.HK ) is due to deliver its best quarterly result since 2013 later this month, thanks to robust refining business and rebound in oil prices. Rival PetroChina expects its first-half profits to more than double from the year-ago period. For the first seven months, China took in 260.83 million tonnes, or 8.98 million bpd of crude oil, up 5.6 percent from a year earlier.  China&rsquo;s refined products exports last month were 4.57 million tonnes, nearly flat from a year earlier. Fuel imports rose 14 percent on year at 2.67 million tonnes.  Total natural gas imports - including pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas - rose to 7.38 million tonnes, up 28.3 percent from a year ago, customs said.  Companies have scaled back purchases of spot LNG cargoes in recent months as prices shot up, traders said.  Year-to-date gas imports grew 34.3 percent on year to 49.43 million tonnes.

The Reserve Bank of India raised the repo rate INREPO=ECI for the second straight meeting last week by 25 basis points to 6.5 percent, while warning about the inflationary pressures. The average inflation is likely to rise to 5.2 percent in 2018\/19 from a 17-year low of 3.6 percent in the previous fiscal year, the IMF said. It said inflationary pressures were also exerted by a pick up in domestic demand and recent hike in procurement prices of major crops by the government, as it seeks to win support from farmers ahead of national elections next year. India&rsquo;s annual consumer inflation INCPIY=ECI hit 5 percent in June, staying above the RBI&rsquo;s medium-term 4 percent target for an eighth consecutive month. &ldquo;The RBI will need to gradually tighten policy further, in response to inflationary pressures, which will help to build monetary credibility,&rdquo; the IMF said in its annual report. The current account deficit is forecast to widen to 2.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2018\/19, from 1.9 percent in the previous year, due to higher oil prices and strong demand for imports. The IMF projected global crude oil prices to average $72 a barrel in 2018\/19, up from $62 in its earlier forecast.  The report welcomed economic reforms undertaken by prime Minister Narendra Modi&rsquo;s government, such as the introduction of a nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) and moves to allow more  foreign investment in new sectors.  The report, prepared after consultations with government officials, also warned that India was at risk of a shortfall in tax revenue this year due to continued problems with implementation of GST and a delay in financial sector reforms. It also forecast India&rsquo;s economy could grow at 7.3 percent in the current fiscal year and 7.5 percent in 2019\/20. Ranil Salgado, IMF mission chief for India said the economy was gaining momentum and the government should reinvigorate reform efforts to accelerate growth and create more jobs. &ldquo;This is critical in a country, where per capita income is about $2,000, still well below that of other large emerging economies.&rdquo; As one of the of world&rsquo;s fastest-growing economies - accounting for about 15 percent of global growth - Indian economy has helped lift millions out of poverty, the report said.

Coming after a string of weak IPO debuts in Hong Kong, China Tower&rsquo;s performance could influence upcoming listings such as Sinochem Energy. It may also weigh on the city&rsquo;s attempts to sustain its record fundraising from stock floats. Shares of China Tower, the world's largest mobile telecommunications tower operator, only edged as high as HK$1.29 before ending unchanged from their IPO price at HK$1.26 by the city's lunchtime trading break. The Hang Seng Index .HSI was trading 0.42 percent higher at noon. Analysts said China Tower holding above its issue price would bode well for the wider market.  &ldquo;Long term institutions will park their funds in firms like China Tower - its the sort of stock you wouldn&rsquo;t expect to see any explosive jump in and it won&rsquo;t attract much retail speculative interest,&rdquo; said Linus Yip, chief strategist of First Shanghai Securities.  Slideshow (7 Images)  Also debuting on Wednesday was Nasdaq-listed BeiGene Ltd (6160.HK ), the second firm to float under new rules in Hong Kong designed to attract biotechs. Shares in the firm, which raised $903 million after pricing its shares at HK$108 each, slipped to HK$105, down 2.7 percent, in morning trade and ended at HK$106.8 at noon. Under rules introduced earlier this year, biotech firms without revenue or profit can apply to list. Ascletis Pharma Inc (1672.HK ), a maker of anti-viral and cancer drugs, last week became this first to list under the new regime, but has seen its shares fall 16.1 percent below their IPO price since debut day. Companies have now raised $22.4 billion in Hong Kong through listings this year, the city&rsquo;s best-ever seven-month performance, data from Thomson Reuters showed. But the Hang Seng Index has dropped almost 16 percent from its January peak amid Sino-U.S. trade tensions, and several recent listings, such as that of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK ), have struggled to maintain their IPO prices. &ldquo;Investors are becoming more cautious and selective toward new listings,&rdquo; said Ben Kwong, head of research and executive director at KGI Asia. &ldquo;The overall pace of the IPO market will slow down a bit and listing candidates may try to avoid this weak sentiment when they can&rsquo;t demand higher valuations.&rdquo;  MOBILE GIANT China Tower priced its IPO last week at the bottom of an indicative range, raising $6.9 billion in the world&rsquo;s biggest listing since Postal Savings Bank of China Co Ltd&rsquo;s (1658.HK ) $7.63 billion Hong Kong float in 2016. The company operates 1.9 million tower sites and had 2.8 million tenants at the end of June, its IPO prospectus showed. It was formed in 2014 from the tower operations of China&rsquo;s three state-backed telecoms providers - China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom - to reduce duplication. China Tower Chairman Tong Jilu, speaking at the open of trading in Hong Kong, said the fact that the company could go public after just three years of operation showed its quality was recognized by investors. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very happy that the international offering of our IPO has attracted global long-long funds, sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds as well as high-quality Chinese investors,&rdquo; he said. China Tower&rsquo;s operating revenue in 2017 rose nearly 23 percent to 68.7 billion yuan ($10.07 billion), while profit rose more than 25 times to 1.9 billion yuan. Its three telecoms shareholders accounted for almost all its revenue last year. China Tower&rsquo;s float is the latest move in a government push to inject new life into bloated state-owned enterprises by encouraging greater private capital investment. Sinochem Energy, a unit of state-owned Sinochem Group, has filed for a $2 billion Hong Kong IPO as the group seeks to raise capital for a shift to higher-value businesses.

Analysts said China Tower holding above its issue price would bode well for the wider market.  &ldquo;Long term institutions will park their funds in firms like China Tower - its the sort of stock you wouldn&rsquo;t expect to see any explosive jump in and it won&rsquo;t attract much retail speculative interest,&rdquo; said Linus Yip, chief strategist of First Shanghai Securities.  Slideshow (7 Images)  Also debuting on Wednesday was Nasdaq-listed BeiGene Ltd (6160.HK ), the second firm to float under new rules in Hong Kong designed to attract biotechs. Shares in the firm, which raised $903 million after pricing its shares at HK$108 each, slipped to HK$105, down 2.7 percent, in morning trade and ended at HK$106.8 at noon. Under rules introduced earlier this year, biotech firms without revenue or profit can apply to list. Ascletis Pharma Inc (1672.HK ), a maker of anti-viral and cancer drugs, last week became this first to list under the new regime, but has seen its shares fall 16.1 percent below their IPO price since debut day. Companies have now raised $22.4 billion in Hong Kong through listings this year, the city&rsquo;s best-ever seven-month performance, data from Thomson Reuters showed. But the Hang Seng Index has dropped almost 16 percent from its January peak amid Sino-U.S. trade tensions, and several recent listings, such as that of Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp (1810.HK ), have struggled to maintain their IPO prices. &ldquo;Investors are becoming more cautious and selective toward new listings,&rdquo; said Ben Kwong, head of research and executive director at KGI Asia. &ldquo;The overall pace of the IPO market will slow down a bit and listing candidates may try to avoid this weak sentiment when they can&rsquo;t demand higher valuations.&rdquo;  MOBILE GIANT China Tower priced its IPO last week at the bottom of an indicative range, raising $6.9 billion in the world&rsquo;s biggest listing since Postal Savings Bank of China Co Ltd&rsquo;s (1658.HK ) $7.63 billion Hong Kong float in 2016. The company operates 1.9 million tower sites and had 2.8 million tenants at the end of June, its IPO prospectus showed. It was formed in 2014 from the tower operations of China&rsquo;s three state-backed telecoms providers - China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom - to reduce duplication. China Tower Chairman Tong Jilu, speaking at the open of trading in Hong Kong, said the fact that the company could go public after just three years of operation showed its quality was recognized by investors. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very happy that the international offering of our IPO has attracted global long-long funds, sovereign wealth funds and hedge funds as well as high-quality Chinese investors,&rdquo; he said. China Tower&rsquo;s operating revenue in 2017 rose nearly 23 percent to 68.7 billion yuan ($10.07 billion), while profit rose more than 25 times to 1.9 billion yuan. Its three telecoms shareholders accounted for almost all its revenue last year. China Tower&rsquo;s float is the latest move in a government push to inject new life into bloated state-owned enterprises by encouraging greater private capital investment. Sinochem Energy, a unit of state-owned Sinochem Group, has filed for a $2 billion Hong Kong IPO as the group seeks to raise capital for a shift to higher-value businesses.

In a reminder of the growing trade disputes, the U.S. Trade Representative&rsquo;s office said late on Tuesday that the United States would begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of goods it imports from China later this month. The move is the latest by Washington to pressure China into negotiating trade concessions after it imposed tariffs on $34 billion of goods in July. China has vowed to retaliate to an equal degree. On Wednesday, the dollar fell 0.15 percent against a basket of six currencies and was at 95.065 at 0330 GMT. It fell as low as 94.994 overnight. &ldquo;Market reaction to the headlines about the U.S.-China trade war is waning,&rdquo; said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities. &ldquo;If there are clear signs of a slowdown of the U.S. economy due to the tariffs imposed in July, then I think the market will begin to price in slower rate hikes or no rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.&rdquo; Since mid-April, the dollar index has risen more than 6 percent, supported by rising interest rates and fears over the impact of trade conflicts. On Wednesday, China&rsquo;s offshore yuan traded at 6.8262 yuan per dollar, paring some gains after hitting a one-week high of 6.8063 earlier in the day. The Australian dollar, often seen as a proxy for China&rsquo;s economic growth because of Australia&rsquo;s heavy reliance on exports to the country, gained 0.1 percent to $0.7431. But it showed a muted response to China&rsquo;s July trade data, the first figures since the United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6. The report showed China&rsquo;s exports and imports rising faster than expected, although the country&rsquo;s trade surplus with the United States was little changed. Elsewhere, the yen stood little changed at 111.38 per dollar. The euro rose almost 0.2 percent to $1.16185. The United States and Japan are scheduled to hold their first bilateral trade talks in Washington on Thursday after Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed in April to a new framework to discuss &ldquo;free, fair and reciprocal&rdquo; trade. &ldquo;If the U.S. criticises Japan&rsquo;s macro-economic or foreign currency policy, it&rsquo;s likely to lead to a stronger yen,&rdquo; said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s quite unlikely that will happen because these talks are the first bilateral trade negotiations as part of the new framework between the U.S. and Japan.&rdquo; "},"9deaff4a399f38c360214eae0d0736b5":{"title":"Undeterred by taxes, IKEA puts together cheap India pricing","text":"HYDERABAD (Reuters) - IKEA will do things differently in India after it opens its first store in the nation on Thursday, as it deals with higher taxes on imported goods and looks to woo cost-conscious shoppers unaccustomed to the company&rsquo;s DIY furniture assembly style.

The company hit snags a few years ago after the government rejected its request to relax rules on buying goods locally. Meanwhile, competition for IKEA in the country has increased as online furniture startups such as Pepperfry and UrbanLadder have become popular in large cities. The overall furniture market, though, remains largely dominated by unorganized retail and local vendors. IKEA had initially planned to open 25 stores across the nation by 2025. In June, the company said it was likely to open more stores, possibly some smaller stores in cities to complement their typically larger showrooms in suburbs. The company has bought land in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Mumbai and Gurugram, and is also looking to expand into Surat, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chennai and Pune.

A weaker yuan, which marked its worst 4-month fall on record between April and July, may have taken the sting out of 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion exports to the United States. However, analysts still expect a less favorable trade balance for China in coming months given it&rsquo;s early days in the tariff brawl. &ldquo;Looking ahead, we expect export growth to cool in the coming months, though this will primarily reflect softer global growth rather than US tariffs, the direct impact of which will continue to be mostly offset by the renminbi&rsquo;s (yuan&rsquo;s) recent depreciation,&rdquo; Capital Economics&rsquo; Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note. After a strong start to the year, growth in the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy cooled slightly in the second quarter, partly hit by the government&rsquo;s years-long efforts to tackle debt risks. The worry is that the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, rising corporate bankruptcies, and a steep decline in the value of the yuan versus the dollar could put a significant dent on the economy.

Repeated hold-ups since the Buffalo, New York plant opened last year have forced Tesla&rsquo;s partner in the joint venture, Panasonic (6752.T ), to seek other buyers for the components it had built to sell to Tesla, according to a Panasonic employee, a former Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee. The issues have also rattled the faith of state officials in Tesla&rsquo;s ability to deliver on investment and employment promises it made in exchange for $750 million in state subsidies. The production challenges add to doubts over Tesla&rsquo;s cash-strapped solar operations as it focuses on boosting production of its better-known electric vehicles, which have also seen repeated production delays. Tesla acquired the solar business in 2016 in a controversial $2.6 billion purchase of SolarCity - a sales and installation company founded by two of Musk&rsquo;s cousins - but the business has been shrinking ever since. (For a graphic showing the decline in Tesla's solar business, see: tmsnrt.rs\/2KjWlYU ) The &ldquo;Solar Roof&rdquo; produced at the New York factory is designed to look like a normal roof while generating electricity, a combination that has proved challenging. &ldquo;Aesthetic look is the key point that Elon is always not satisfied with,&rdquo; said another former Tesla employee, who works in Fremont, California. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the big issue.&rdquo; In a call with Tesla investors last week, Musk said &ldquo;hundreds&rdquo; of homes already had solar roofs, but the company clarified the estimate in its statement to Reuters, saying it included systems that had been partially installed or were &ldquo;being scheduled for install.&rdquo; In California, the nation&rsquo;s leading solar market, there were twelve Tesla roof systems connected to the grid as of May 31, all in Northern California, according to records from the state&rsquo;s three investor-owned utilities. The cost per watt for those systems was listed at nearly $6, according to the records. That&rsquo;s about double the national average for solar systems. Tesla began accepting $1,000 deposits from customers for the Solar Roofs in May 2017, seven months after it unveiled a prototype. Tesla confirmed in a statement to Reuters that it has been seeking to improve on its production process for the solar roof at the New York plant. &ldquo;We are steadily ramping up Solar Roof production in Buffalo and are also continuing to iterate on the product design and production process,&rdquo; the company said in the statement. &ldquo;We plan to ramp production more toward the end of 2018.&rdquo; The company did not detail its current production and did not comment on its component purchases from partner Panasonic, which shares space in the factory and plans to produce Tesla solar panels and photovoltaic cells for the roofs. Slideshow (3 Images)  Panasonic has been selling some of the solar panels it produces in Buffalo under its own brand instead of selling them to Tesla, Panasonic said in a statement. It has also been shipping a large volume of the photovoltaic cells it produces in Buffalo as samples to prospective buyers because of low demand from Tesla, according to the Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee. Panasonic declined to comment on the shipments of cell samples to other customers but said in a statement that it has not yet completed sales to buyers other than Tesla or signed alternate supply deals. &ldquo;We believe Tesla will use Panasonic cells when it mass-markets the Solar Roof,&rdquo; the company said in a statement.  Some New York state lawmakers worry Tesla may fail to hold up its end of the bargain. The state provided $350 million to build the factory, along with $274.7 million for equipment and $125.3 million &ldquo;for additional specified scope costs,&rdquo; according to a Tesla filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The subsidy package requires Tesla to employ 1,460 people in Buffalo, including 500 at the plant, within two years of the facility&rsquo;s completion, and to spend $5 billion in the state over a decade. Empire State Development, the state&rsquo;s economic development arm, is overseeing the agreement. The agency believes Tesla is currently meeting its obligations, said spokeswoman Pamm Lent, adding that the company would face penalties of $41.2 million a year if it falters. Republican New York state Assemblyman Ray Walter, who represents a district near the factory, said it concerned him that only a small portion of the plant appeared functional when he toured it in March. &ldquo;After investing $750 million of taxpayer money, we want it to work out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It just does not look like it&rsquo;s heading down that path.&rdquo; Tesla said in its statement that the facility now employs about 600 people and is on track to meet all of its commitments. None of the Tesla sources could provide a production figure for the solar roof, saying only that output was low and frequently interrupted. They said only the textured black version of the solar roof had been produced so far, one of four varieties Tesla is marketing.  Several of the sources at the plant said Musk had never visited the site; Tesla declined to comment. EQUIPMENT IN BOXES Panasonic recently produced about 1,900 conventional 325-watt solar panels per day at the plant, meant to be sold under the Tesla brand, and about 2,000 5.5-watt photovoltaic cells per day that were intended for the solar roof, according to two Panasonic sources, one who recently left the company. That would put annualized production at about a quarter of Tesla&rsquo;s target for the plant, which is 1 gigawatt per year by 2019. And Tesla isn&rsquo;t buying most of the cells being produced, according to the Panasonic employee. &ldquo;We have been entertaining outside customers,&rdquo; the employee said. Tesla is also turning to other suppliers to deal with the aesthetic concerns, using cells from JA Solar because they reflect light differently, said a current Tesla employee and a former Tesla employee. The current employee said a similar Panasonic cell was now undergoing testing and would be used in future versions of the solar roof. JA Solar declined to comment. Panasonic started cell production at the factory in February, but recently shut down manufacturing to install new equipment on its production lines, the Panasonic employee said. Full production will restart in September, the employee said. For now, wooden crates filled with unused equipment are sitting around the factory, according to the Panasonic employee and three other employees with knowledge of the plant operations. Some of that equipment has become obsolete over the past couple of years as technology has changed, two of the workers said. MIXED REVIEWS One of the few customers that has taken delivery of the Solar Roof is Tri Huynh, 39, who works in business development in Silicon Valley. Huynh said he paid about $100,000 for the system, which included three Tesla Powerwall home batteries to store the power produced. It took two weeks and a dozen workers to install, compared to a day for most traditional panel systems. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fantastic. I love it,&rdquo; he said, adding he was saving hundreds of dollars a month in power costs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a tech guy, so I kind of wanted the latest technology.&rdquo; Warren Jason, a retired technology entrepreneur who is building an 11,000-square-foot house in the Hollywood Hills, is not so pleased.  He put down $1,000 to reserve a roof in early 2017 but it has not yet arrived, and he has been unable to get details to give to his architect and engineers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been begging Tesla for information,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been extremely frustrating.&rdquo; "},"cda912a6bedf72735051cf0d14791bbd":{"title":"Chinese exports accelerate as U.S. prepares new tariffs in heated row","text":"BEIJING (Reuters) - China&rsquo;s exports surged more than expected in July despite fresh U.S. duties and its closely watched surplus with the United States remained near record highs, as Washington finalised its new tariff list in a bitter dispute that some fear could derail global growth.

Tesla began accepting $1,000 deposits from customers for the Solar Roofs in May 2017, seven months after it unveiled a prototype. Tesla confirmed in a statement to Reuters that it has been seeking to improve on its production process for the solar roof at the New York plant. &ldquo;We are steadily ramping up Solar Roof production in Buffalo and are also continuing to iterate on the product design and production process,&rdquo; the company said in the statement. &ldquo;We plan to ramp production more toward the end of 2018.&rdquo; The company did not detail its current production and did not comment on its component purchases from partner Panasonic, which shares space in the factory and plans to produce Tesla solar panels and photovoltaic cells for the roofs. Slideshow (3 Images)  Panasonic has been selling some of the solar panels it produces in Buffalo under its own brand instead of selling them to Tesla, Panasonic said in a statement. It has also been shipping a large volume of the photovoltaic cells it produces in Buffalo as samples to prospective buyers because of low demand from Tesla, according to the Panasonic employee and a former Tesla employee. Panasonic declined to comment on the shipments of cell samples to other customers but said in a statement that it has not yet completed sales to buyers other than Tesla or signed alternate supply deals. &ldquo;We believe Tesla will use Panasonic cells when it mass-markets the Solar Roof,&rdquo; the company said in a statement.  Some New York state lawmakers worry Tesla may fail to hold up its end of the bargain. The state provided $350 million to build the factory, along with $274.7 million for equipment and $125.3 million &ldquo;for additional specified scope costs,&rdquo; according to a Tesla filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The subsidy package requires Tesla to employ 1,460 people in Buffalo, including 500 at the plant, within two years of the facility&rsquo;s completion, and to spend $5 billion in the state over a decade. Empire State Development, the state&rsquo;s economic development arm, is overseeing the agreement. The agency believes Tesla is currently meeting its obligations, said spokeswoman Pamm Lent, adding that the company would face penalties of $41.2 million a year if it falters. Republican New York state Assemblyman Ray Walter, who represents a district near the factory, said it concerned him that only a small portion of the plant appeared functional when he toured it in March. &ldquo;After investing $750 million of taxpayer money, we want it to work out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It just does not look like it&rsquo;s heading down that path.&rdquo; Tesla said in its statement that the facility now employs about 600 people and is on track to meet all of its commitments. None of the Tesla sources could provide a production figure for the solar roof, saying only that output was low and frequently interrupted. They said only the textured black version of the solar roof had been produced so far, one of four varieties Tesla is marketing.  Several of the sources at the plant said Musk had never visited the site; Tesla declined to comment. EQUIPMENT IN BOXES Panasonic recently produced about 1,900 conventional 325-watt solar panels per day at the plant, meant to be sold under the Tesla brand, and about 2,000 5.5-watt photovoltaic cells per day that were intended for the solar roof, according to two Panasonic sources, one who recently left the company. That would put annualized production at about a quarter of Tesla&rsquo;s target for the plant, which is 1 gigawatt per year by 2019. And Tesla isn&rsquo;t buying most of the cells being produced, according to the Panasonic employee. &ldquo;We have been entertaining outside customers,&rdquo; the employee said. Tesla is also turning to other suppliers to deal with the aesthetic concerns, using cells from JA Solar because they reflect light differently, said a current Tesla employee and a former Tesla employee. The current employee said a similar Panasonic cell was now undergoing testing and would be used in future versions of the solar roof. JA Solar declined to comment. Panasonic started cell production at the factory in February, but recently shut down manufacturing to install new equipment on its production lines, the Panasonic employee said. Full production will restart in September, the employee said. For now, wooden crates filled with unused equipment are sitting around the factory, according to the Panasonic employee and three other employees with knowledge of the plant operations. Some of that equipment has become obsolete over the past couple of years as technology has changed, two of the workers said. MIXED REVIEWS One of the few customers that has taken delivery of the Solar Roof is Tri Huynh, 39, who works in business development in Silicon Valley. Huynh said he paid about $100,000 for the system, which included three Tesla Powerwall home batteries to store the power produced. It took two weeks and a dozen workers to install, compared to a day for most traditional panel systems. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fantastic. I love it,&rdquo; he said, adding he was saving hundreds of dollars a month in power costs. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a tech guy, so I kind of wanted the latest technology.&rdquo; Warren Jason, a retired technology entrepreneur who is building an 11,000-square-foot house in the Hollywood Hills, is not so pleased.  He put down $1,000 to reserve a roof in early 2017 but it has not yet arrived, and he has been unable to get details to give to his architect and engineers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been begging Tesla for information,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been extremely frustrating.&rdquo; "},"8dcfaab736d1d0ad7511f7612e077c22":{"title":"Chinese exports accelerate as U.S. prepares new tariffs in heated row","text":"BEIJING (Reuters) - China&rsquo;s exports surged more than expected in July despite fresh U.S. duties and its closely watched surplus with the United States remained near record highs, as Washington finalised its new tariff list in a bitter dispute that some fear could derail global growth. In the latest move by President Donald Trump to put pressure on Beijing to negotiate trade concessions, Washington is set to begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods on Aug. 23. Both countries have already slapped tit-for-tat duties on $34 billion of each other&rsquo;s goods. China has repeatedly warned it will strike back, and has already begun enforcing or is getting ready to enforce its own retaliatory tariffs, saying the United States is threatening the global free trade order with its protectionism. China&rsquo;s headline numbers are the first readings of the overall trade picture for the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy since U.S duties on $34 billion of Chinese imports came into effect on July 6. China&rsquo;s surplus with the United States shrank marginally to $28.09 billion last month from a record $28.97 billion in June. Washington has long criticized China&rsquo;s trade surplus with the United States and has demanded Beijing cut it.  Still, disagreements between the two major economic powers run deeper than just the trade balance and tensions remain over market access, intellectual property, technology transfer and investment. A weaker yuan, which marked its worst 4-month fall on record between April and July, may have taken the sting out of 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion exports to the United States. However, analysts still expect a less favorable trade balance for China in coming months given it&rsquo;s early days in the tariff brawl. &ldquo;Looking ahead, we expect export growth to cool in the coming months, though this will primarily reflect softer global growth rather than US tariffs, the direct impact of which will continue to be mostly offset by the renminbi&rsquo;s (yuan&rsquo;s) recent depreciation,&rdquo; Capital Economics&rsquo; Senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note. After a strong start to the year, growth in the world&rsquo;s second-largest economy cooled slightly in the second quarter, partly hit by the government&rsquo;s years-long efforts to tackle debt risks. The worry is that the escalating Sino-U.S. trade war, rising corporate bankruptcies, and a steep decline in the value of the yuan versus the dollar could put a significant dent on the economy.  The government has responded by releasing more liquidity into the banking system, encouraging lending and promising a more &ldquo;active&rdquo; fiscal policy. World financial markets have taken a battering in recent months as fears grow that Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;America First&rdquo; policies could derail a global economic revival. &ldquo;STICK OF HEGEMONY&rdquo;    Chinese state media, reflecting the government&rsquo;s stance, has said China will not be cowed in the face of U.S. threats.  The latest commentary from state media on Wednesday took a softer line after resorting to personal attacks against Trump earlier in the week, saying China could get through the storm but refrained from directly mentioning the U.S. president. All China&rsquo;s main state newspapers published a lengthy commentary by the official Xinhua news agency, entitled &ldquo;declaration&rdquo;, on their front pages. &ldquo;Certain people go against the tide for their own private ends and go against morality; the barrier of tariffs wantonly rise, and the stick of hegemony is raised all around,&rdquo; the commentary said. &ldquo;Although this may for a moment bring preening with delight, it will make it hard to resolve economic imbalances or out of kilter politics and other deep-rooted problems,&rdquo; it said. China has already retaliated against the United States with its own tariffs and proposed others if Washington goes ahead with all its threats. It has not yet given a date for its previously announced retaliatory tariffs on $16 billion in U.S. goods, which will target commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, coal and some refined oil products. The latest $16 billion list from the United States will hit semiconductors from China, even though many of the basic chips in these products originate from the United States, Taiwan or South Korea. John Neuffer, president and CEO of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said in a statement they were disappointed and puzzled why semiconductors remain on the final tariff list. &ldquo;We have made the case to the Administration, in the strongest possible terms, that tariffs imposed on semiconductors imported from China will hurt America&rsquo;s chipmakers, not China&rsquo;s, and will do nothing to stop China&rsquo;s problematic and discriminatory trade practices,&rdquo; he said.

Now the Tesla Inc (TSLA.O ) CEO is looking to reengineer how a company can be taken private. Musk announced on Twitter on Tuesday that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share, or $72 billion, in what would be the biggest deal of this kind. He said the funding for the deal was secured, but did not provide details. Tesla shares ended up 11 percent at $379.57, indicating investors gave some credence to the plan. But investment bankers and analysts reacted with skepticism, telling Reuters it would be hard for Musk, whose net worth is pegged by Forbes at $22 billion, to raise the equity and debt financing needed for the deal given Tesla is not turning a profit. &ldquo;The company is cash-flow negative. How do you use any debt on a company that is cash-flow negative?&rdquo; said Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago professor who researches private equity. Finding equity partners and bank financing is key to take-private deals. When Michael Dell took his eponymous computer maker private for $24.9 billion in 2013, for example, he brought in buyout firm Silver Lake that contributed $1.4 billion in equity, raised more than $10 billion in bank debt, and received a $2 billion loan from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O ).  When a Twitter user commented on Musk&rsquo;s proposed deal by posting &ldquo;Just like Dell did. It saves a lot of headaches&rdquo;, Musk responded by tweeting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. Dell&rsquo;s take-private deal, however, may not be possible to replicate with Tesla, which has a $10.9 billion debt pile, is losing money, and whose bonds are rated junk by credit ratings agencies. Without the ability to add more debt, Musk may have to turn to sources of capital that are less accustomed to using debt to juice returns in the way private equity firms are.  SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS One option could be sovereign wealth funds, investment bankers said.  Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has taken a stake of less than 5 percent in Tesla, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. PIF did not respond to a request for comment on whether it would bankroll Musk&rsquo;s take-private deal. SoftBank Group Corp&rsquo;s (9984.T ) $93 billion Vision Fund, whose investors include the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, is seen as an obvious partner given its appetite for big technology investments, but was not contacted by Musk and is not interested in a deal given its investment in Tesla competitor Cruise, the self-driving car unit of General Motors Co (GM.N ), according to a source familiar with the matter. SoftBank declined to comment. China&rsquo;s Tencent Holdings (0700.HK ), which took a 5 percent stake in Tesla last year, is another possible partner.  However foreign capital sources would be subject to scrutiny by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews deals for potential national security risks. Any proposal for funding from Chinese firms could face even tougher checks amid mounting U.S.-China trade tensions. Many attempts by founders and top executives to take their companies private have never come to fruition. In March, Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O ) Chairman Paul Jacobs stepped down from the board to pursue a long-shot take-private bid for the U.S. chip maker, which has a market capitalization of $93 billion. To date, this bid has not materialized.  U.S. department store operator Nordstrom Inc&rsquo;s (JWN.N ) attempt to go private also failed earlier this year, after banks balked at providing the necessary financing to the founding family members seeking to put together the deal. SPECIAL PURPOSE VEHICLE Musk has said he would be looking to keep his ownership of Tesla at around 20 percent and that a special purpose vehicle, like the one that exists at his aerospace company SpaceX, would allow Tesla shareholders to remain invested if they so choose, and then cash out when they wanted. But sources familiar with SpaceX told Reuters it is not clear how Musk would apply it to Tesla. Fidelity Investments, the major backer of SpaceX, did not invest in it through a special purpose vehicle, according to the sources. Fidelity declined to comment, while SpaceX and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. SpaceX only has a limited number of shareholders, who often choose to sell on their shares in the private market.  By contrast, allowing thousands of Tesla shareholders to remain invested through a special purpose vehicle would essentially mean that shares in that new vehicle are publicly traded in some way. Even if such a deal was cobbled together, it is not clear whether so-called &ldquo;liquidity events&rdquo;, that Musk said he organizes at SpaceX every six months, would be sufficient for all existing Tesla investors to cash out. &ldquo;To have a deal of this size, that&rsquo;d be unprecedented as far as I can remember,&rdquo; Kaplan said.

Although official results won&rsquo;t be announced until mid-August, Hun Sen&rsquo;s Cambodian People&rsquo;s Party (CPP) said it had won all 125 parliamentary seats following the July 29 vote.  Critics say a campaign of intimidation by Hun Sen and his allies preceded the vote.

Republican Troy Balderson led Democrat Danny O&rsquo;Connor by about 1,700 votes with all precincts reporting, although the Ohio secretary of state&rsquo;s office said a final result would be delayed until more than 8,000 provisional and absentee ballots were counted. The close race in the Ohio special election became a referendum on Trump&rsquo;s leadership and a last chance to gauge Democratic strength ahead of November&rsquo;s midterm elections. The narrow margin will be little comfort for Republicans anxious about the prospect of a Democratic wave heading into the Nov. 6 elections, and it is certain to encourage Democrats who performed dramatically better than expected in a district Republicans have represented since the early 1980s. The central Ohio race was the marquee contest on a day when four other states held nominating contests, including a battle for governor in Michigan in which a mainstream candidate beat a progressive and a high-profile conservative challenge to the incumbent Republican governor in Kansas. The Ohio contest drew an avalanche of national attention in recent weeks as polls showed it tightening, with Republicans and their allies outspending Democratic groups by more than 4 to 1 and running ads linking O&rsquo;Connor to liberal House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. O&rsquo;Connor, a local county official, tried to project a moderate image, saying he would support new Democratic leadership in Congress and work with Republicans but also criticizing the Trump tax cut. Trump took credit for the apparent Republican victory, saying on Twitter that Balderson&rsquo;s campaign made &ldquo;a big turn for the better&rdquo; after he campaigned for him in the district on Saturday night. Balderson told supporters in Ohio: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to thank President Trump.&rdquo; Other Republicans had also rushed to Balderson&rsquo;s aid. Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Trump critic, endorsed Balderson and Vice President Mike Pence visited. &lsquo;NOT STOPPING&rsquo; Trump won the district by 11 percentage points in the White House race in 2016 and Republican Pat Tiberi won re-election to the House by a whopping 37 percentage points. However, Tiberi resigned before finishing his term, forcing the special election to replace him. O&rsquo;Connor and Balderson will face off again in November to serve a full two-year term. Under Ohio law, the remaining absentee and provisional ballots cannot be counted for 11 days, the secretary of state&rsquo;s office said. Once they are tallied, an automatic recount would be triggered if the margin of results is within 0.5 percent. O&rsquo;Connor refused to concede on Tuesday night and urged supporters on Twitter to make donations for what &ldquo;could be a long and expensive recount.&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not stopping now. Tomorrow we rest and then we keep fighting through to November,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Connor told supporters at a post-election party. The Ohio district includes many of the suburban women and college-educated, affluent residents that polls show have been the sort of voters turned off by Trump&rsquo;s chaotic first 19 months in office. Democrats need to pick up 23 seats in the House and two seats in the Senate to win majorities in those chambers and put the brakes on Trump&rsquo;s agenda. All 435 House seats, 35 of 100 Senate seats and 36 of 50 governors&rsquo; offices are up for grabs in November.    Michigan, Missouri, Kansas and Washington held primaries on Tuesday, setting the stage for a number of competitive congressional and governor&rsquo;s races in November. The Democratic race for governor in Michigan tested the electoral power of the party&rsquo;s progressive wing. However, former Detroit health director Abdul El-Sayed lost his bid to become the country&rsquo;s first Muslim governor to a more moderate Democrat, former state Senate leader Gretchen Whitmer. Whitmer will face Republican Bill Schuette, who was endorsed by Trump, in November. In Kansas, Kris Kobach, a conservative leader in the movement to restrict illegal immigration and pass more restrictive voting laws, narrowly led Governor Jeff Colyer with about 84 percent of the votes counted for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. However, most of the votes in Johnson County, the state&rsquo;s most populous county, had yet to be counted, according to the Kansas elections website. Trump endorsed Kobach, Kansas&rsquo; secretary of state, on Monday. Kobach was an immigration adviser to Trump&rsquo;s campaign in 2016 and vice chairman of Trump&rsquo;s commission to investigate voting fraud before the panel collapsed.

Republican Troy Balderson led Democrat Danny O&rsquo;Connor by about 1,700 votes with all precincts reporting, although the Ohio secretary of state&rsquo;s office said a final result would be delayed until more than 8,000 provisional and absentee ballots were counted. The close race in the Ohio special election became a referendum on Trump&rsquo;s leadership and a last chance to gauge Democratic strength ahead of November&rsquo;s midterm elections. The narrow margin will be little comfort for Republicans anxious about the prospect of a Democratic wave heading into the Nov. 6 elections, and it is certain to encourage Democrats who performed dramatically better than expected in a district Republicans have represented since the early 1980s. The central Ohio race was the marquee contest on a day when four other states held nominating contests, including a battle for governor in Michigan in which a mainstream candidate beat a progressive and a high-profile conservative challenge to the incumbent Republican governor in Kansas. The Ohio contest drew an avalanche of national attention in recent weeks as polls showed it tightening, with Republicans and their allies outspending Democratic groups by more than 4 to 1 and running ads linking O&rsquo;Connor to liberal House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. O&rsquo;Connor, a local county official, tried to project a moderate image, saying he would support new Democratic leadership in Congress and work with Republicans but also criticizing the Trump tax cut. Trump took credit for the apparent Republican victory, saying on Twitter that Balderson&rsquo;s campaign made &ldquo;a big turn for the better&rdquo; after he campaigned for him in the district on Saturday night. Balderson told supporters in Ohio: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to thank President Trump.&rdquo; Other Republicans had also rushed to Balderson&rsquo;s aid. Ohio Governor John Kasich, a Trump critic, endorsed Balderson and Vice President Mike Pence visited. &lsquo;NOT STOPPING&rsquo; Trump won the district by 11 percentage points in the White House race in 2016 and Republican Pat Tiberi won re-election to the House by a whopping 37 percentage points. However, Tiberi resigned before finishing his term, forcing the special election to replace him. O&rsquo;Connor and Balderson will face off again in November to serve a full two-year term. Under Ohio law, the remaining absentee and provisional ballots cannot be counted for 11 days, the secretary of state&rsquo;s office said. Once they are tallied, an automatic recount would be triggered if the margin of results is within 0.5 percent. O&rsquo;Connor refused to concede on Tuesday night and urged supporters on Twitter to make donations for what &ldquo;could be a long and expensive recount.&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not stopping now. Tomorrow we rest and then we keep fighting through to November,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Connor told supporters at a post-election party. The Ohio district includes many of the suburban women and college-educated, affluent residents that polls show have been the sort of voters turned off by Trump&rsquo;s chaotic first 19 months in office. Democrats need to pick up 23 seats in the House and two seats in the Senate to win majorities in those chambers and put the brakes on Trump&rsquo;s agenda. All 435 House seats, 35 of 100 Senate seats and 36 of 50 governors&rsquo; offices are up for grabs in November.    Michigan, Missouri, Kansas and Washington held primaries on Tuesday, setting the stage for a number of competitive congressional and governor&rsquo;s races in November. The Democratic race for governor in Michigan tested the electoral power of the party&rsquo;s progressive wing. However, former Detroit health director Abdul El-Sayed lost his bid to become the country&rsquo;s first Muslim governor to a more moderate Democrat, former state Senate leader Gretchen Whitmer. Whitmer will face Republican Bill Schuette, who was endorsed by Trump, in November. In Kansas, Kris Kobach, a conservative leader in the movement to restrict illegal immigration and pass more restrictive voting laws, narrowly led Governor Jeff Colyer with about 84 percent of the votes counted for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. However, most of the votes in Johnson County, the state&rsquo;s most populous county, had yet to be counted, according to the Kansas elections website. Trump endorsed Kobach, Kansas&rsquo; secretary of state, on Monday. Kobach was an immigration adviser to Trump&rsquo;s campaign in 2016 and vice chairman of Trump&rsquo;s commission to investigate voting fraud before the panel collapsed. In Missouri, voters overwhelmingly decided to overturn a right-to-work law passed by the legislature that targeted union organizing. Bob McCulloch, the incumbent prosecutor in St. Louis county who was criticized for his conduct following the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson that sparked the &ldquo;Black Lives Matter&rdquo; movement, also lost a primary race to Wesley Bell, a Ferguson city council member who has vowed criminal justice reform.

These include self-driving delivery vans, third-party delivery contractors and curbside pickup in Kroger parking lots. Most of these efforts are an attempt to leverage one of the company&rsquo;s most valuable assets: brick-and-mortar stores located within a mile or two of most of its current customers.  But Kroger is breaking with that familiar model for its next big push. It is betting big on giant warehouses staffed with fast robots to pack orders straight for delivery to shoppers. In May, Kroger paid roughly $248 million for a minority stake in Ocado (OCDO.L ), a British company whose newest machines can pull together a 50-item grocery order in as little as five minutes. That technology leapfrogs what is currently in use by any retailer in the United States.

They declined to name locations, but said Kroger plans to break into at least one new area where it does not have existing stores. Industry veterans said Kroger&rsquo;s partnership with Ocado was a bold move that positions the company, which posted 2017 sales of $123 billion, to grab share from younger players seen as nimbler and more innovative.          &ldquo;This will be a game-changer ... and probably the most likely catalyst for grocery e-commerce in the U.S. to take off,&rdquo; said London-based Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, a former e-commerce executive at British food seller Tesco (TSCO.L ). Kroger executives would not say whether they will use their own drivers or outsource delivery from the sheds. Meanwhile, the company has teamed up with Silicon Valley self-driving startup Nuro to test a driverless delivery van in Phoenix. And Kroger continues to invest in curbside pickup. Earlier this month it launched a beefed-up online shopping service called Kroger Ship that sends packages directly from its distribution centers via United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N ) and FedEx Corp (FDX.N ).  But competitors are not sitting still.     Walmart, which waged a brutal price war to become the top U.S. grocery seller, recently launched its own self-driving car project. Later this year it will begin testing automated grocery picking at a supercenter in Salem, New Hampshire. Amazon, meanwhile, already sells more non-perishable groceries online than any other retailer. It spent $13.7 billion last year to acquire the Whole Foods supermarket chain with an eye to turning those stores into distribution hubs to bolster its AmazonFresh delivery service. The company just launched curbside pickup at Whole Foods, starting with stores in Sacramento, California and Virginia Beach, Virginia. DEMAND DILEMMA               It is all largely a bet on the future. Analysts say online grocery purchases currently account for just 1 percent to 4 percent of U.S. industry sales. Three-quarters of online shoppers surveyed said they rarely or never buy groceries that way, according to a new Reuters\/Ipsos telephone poll of nearly 6,000 adults fielded from June 26 to July 11. (For a look at why U.S. shoppers are not buying groceries online, see: tmsnrt.rs\/2LYQUUV)  Investment in automation has spurred faster growth overseas. Online grocery sales account for 5.6 percent of the market in the United Kingdom and 3.8 percent in China, compared to 1 percent in the United States, according to market research firm IGD Retail. Kroger is letting go of old models that have proven unprofitable. Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman revealed for the first time that the company never made money on Home Shop, a roughly 30-year-old delivery service it shuttered in April. Kroger offered it in just 20 stores in the company&rsquo;s King Soopers division in the Rocky Mountain area, for prices ranging from $10.95 for an internet order to $20.90 for telephone orders. That was not enough to cover the cost of labor and the expense of operating a fleet of refrigerated trucks.     &ldquo;It&rsquo;s highly inefficient to do that out of a store. You can&rsquo;t get the critical mass you need,&rdquo; Schlotman said. Kroger replaced Home Shop with Instacart, one of a handful of third-party delivery firms that now serve more than 1,200 Kroger stores.  Monteyne, the supermarket analyst, said Kroger&rsquo;s new delivery push is a recognition of the value of online shoppers. These customers crave convenience and tend to spend more per order than those who just drop by the supermarket for a few items. The &ldquo;first-mover&rdquo; advantage is key to locking them in.

Arrivals came in at 29.01 million tonnes last month, the General Administration of Customs said. That is the highest since January 2014. Imports rose 23.9 percent from 25.47 million tonnes in June and climbed 49.1 percent from 19.46 million tonnes in July 2017. Electric power loads on the transmission grid in parts of China soared late last month because of high temperatures, with southern areas of the Hebei province that surrounds Beijing reporting record demand and the State Grid Corporation of China [STGRD.UL] warning of power shortages. The China Meteorological Administration has been issuing regular heat alerts over the past few weeks. On Wednesday, it warned regions in western and southern China could see temperatures reaching as high as 40 degrees Celsius (104\u00b0F), which would continue to support demand for coal-fired electricity. Increased buying of foreign shipments has also been spurred by curbs on domestic output as Beijing increases checks on heavy industry to clear air pollution. Thermal coal prices for delivery in September CZVU8 were up 0.1 pct to 614.2 yuan per ton before the lunchtime break on Wednesday after earlier hitting 623.2 yuan, the highest since July 13. The data is also another signal that customs has relaxed its checks on foreign shipments, which had slowed arrivals earlier this year. Cheng Gong, coal analyst at Zheshang Securities, said imports were higher than he expected. &ldquo;The authorities have vowed to ensure coal supplies and keep prices running smoothly during the peak season, therefore checks on imports could not be tightened in the short term,&rdquo; he said.

Describing the find as &ldquo;truly incredible&rdquo;, junior joint venture partner Carnarvon said on Wednesday more oil had been found in the Dorado-1 well, with the thickness of the oil column now measured at 132 meters. That was up from the 80 meters indicated in a drilling update in July. Carnarvon shares rocketed to a nine-year high after the announcement, and last traded up 25 percent at 60.5 cents, valuing the company at A$720 million ($535 million).  Unlisted Quadrant was potentially worth A$3 billion before the Dorado find, with bankers saying its 50 percent owner Brookfield Asset Management is looking to sell its stake. Private equity firms are expected to drive a wave of merger activity in Australia&rsquo;s oil and gas sector, hunting for assets in a market with good access to China and southeast Asia, where energy demand is rapidly growing. Energy consultants Wood Mackenzie said they saw the discovery as the biggest in Western Australia in more than two decades, in an area better known for its gas. Without knowing the boundaries of the reservoir, they estimate it could hold well above 150 million barrels of oil. &ldquo;I think easily it would be above 150 million barrels, and I think it&rsquo;s heading much further north than that,&rdquo; said Wood Mackenzie analyst David Low. Carnarvon, with a 20 percent stake in the venture, said it was excited about the prospect, now being assessed by operator Quadrant, owned by Brookfield, Macquarie Group, Wesfarmers and mining heiress Angela Bennett. Quadrant Energy Chief Executive Brett Darley said the early results were &ldquo;extremely promising&rdquo;, in an emailed comment.  &ldquo;The oil discovered in the Caley Member (of Dorado-1) is very significant in terms of its likely scale and in proving that this play works in the basin,&rdquo; Carnarvon Managing Director Adrian Cook said in a statement.  Wood Mackenzie&rsquo;s Low said the find would boost interest in both partners in the project. &ldquo;It looks like there&rsquo;s a lot of upside for Carnarvon. It could be interesting for someone who wants to get into oil in Australia,&rdquo; Low said. Bankers say Quadrant had considered an IPO, but scrapped the plan early this year, with Brookfield still looking to sell its stake. Low said the Dorado oil find would now boost the value of Quadrant, as oil would be cheaper to develop than gas and would have a ready market in Asia. &ldquo;It definitely makes it a bit more attractive. It&rsquo;s now got more of a diversified portfolio. It has an oil play now,&rdquo; Low said. Quadrant supplies more than a fifth of the domestic gas market in Western Australia and does not need more gas yet in a region with abundant gas reserves vying to be developed.

The Shanghai Composite index .SSEC fell 0.3 percent, and the blue-chip CSI300 index .CSI300 was 0.6 percent lower.     Both indexes posted their biggest daily gains since 2016 on Tuesday, rebounding from four days of heavy losses and raising hopes that their dizzying trade-induced slide into correction territory may be easing up. Stocks remained in the red despite stronger-than-expected July export data which appeared to show that an earlier round of U.S. tariffs has yet to have a significant impact on global demand for China&rsquo;s goods.     In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index .HSI gained 0.3 percent and the China Enterprises index .HSCE was up 0.5 percent. Attention in Hong Kong was on the market debut of China Tower Corp Ltd (0788.HK ), the world&rsquo;s largest initial public offering in two years. The company&rsquo;s shares were little changed as trade war fears weighed on sentiment. Chinese stock markets are highly sensitive to changes in liquidity and have generally been quick to respond to even vague pledges of government pump priming in the past. But the flurry of punitive trade blows from the Trump administration and little sign of compromise from either side has left many investors doubtful of a sustained turnaround for shares in the near term. &ldquo;China&rsquo;s monetary and fiscal policies have shifted from prudent to growth supportive. The ongoing and protracted trade tension has elevated uncertainties which prompted more concerns over downside risks to growth,&rdquo; Christy Tan, head of markets strategy and research, Asia, at National Australia Bank, said in a note. Earlier on Wednesday, the U.S. said it will begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods from Aug. 23, and Chinese media have resorted to personal attacks against President Donald Trump.  The measures come after Washington slapped tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods last month.  Escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war has threatened to put more pressure on the already cooling Chinese economy, and has prompted a series of growth boosting measures from Beijing. Last week, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party promised more flexible and effective policy to boost growth, and authorities are taking steps to offer more credit at cheaper interest rates to small and medium-sized firms which are seen as most vulnerable. The plans appear to be offering respite for some investment-intensive companies that were badly mauled in the broad based market selloff in recent weeks. Shares in China Railway Construction Corp Ltd (601186.SS ) rose 0.6 percent on Wednesday, a day after jumping the daily 10 percent limit on news that China would boost its fixed asset investment in railways to 800 billion yuan ($116.85 billion) in 2018, an increase of 9.3 percent over its original plan. Beijing is also taking steps to ease financing constraints on borrowers, which have been fueled in part by a multi-year campaign to reduce excessive financial risks and slow a rapid build-up in debt.     On Wednesday, the state planner said that China would use monetary policy such as targeted cuts in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks to support debt-to-equity swaps this year as it looks to lower corporate leverage ratios. STRONGER YUAN While China&rsquo;s stock markets remain fragile, there are hopes among global investors that Beijing is moving to stabilize the yuan currency. After allowing the yuan to fall for eight straight weeks against the U.S. dollar, triggering global fears China may be embarking on a &ldquo;stealth devaluation&rdquo;, there are signs that authorities are now attempting to put a floor under the currency and discourage bets on further losses that could trigger capital outflows. The yuan strengthened on Wednesday, as the central bank guided the currency higher with its daily fixing. The upbeat trade data appeared to have little impact. A Bloomberg report, citing unnamed sources, said that China&rsquo;s central bank on Monday urged some banks to prevent &ldquo;herd behavior&rdquo; and momentum-chasing moves in the foreign-exchange market. On Wednesday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint of the yuan's daily trading band CNY=PBOC at 6.8313 per dollar, 118 pips firmer than the previous fixing of 6.8431. The currency opened at 6.8140 per dollar on the spot market CNY=CFXS and was changing hands at 6.8217 as of 0336 GMT, 61 pips firmer than the previous late session close of 6.8278. The central bank set a reserve requirement ratio of 20 percent from Monday for financial institutions settling foreign exchange forward dollar sales to clients, effectively raising the cost for investors shorting the yuan. While many analysts still expect the currency to test the level of 7 to the U.S. dollar, Ken Hu, chief investment officer for Asia Pacific fixed income at Invesco in Hong Kong said he maintained a more positive outlook in the longer term. &ldquo;We see limited depreciation pressure on the RMB in the near future and are confident that Chinese regulatory authorities have sufficient tools to manage any exaggerated one-way market move,&rdquo; he said in a note. &ldquo;We believe that strong domestic demand in China provides enough buffer to counter potential impact from rising trade tariffs,&rdquo; he added.

ABN said it would focus its Corporate and Institutional Banking (CIB) division to higher-yielding activities, such as lending to Dutch corporations, clearing and private equity. &ldquo;To improve profitability, capital allocated to CIB will be reduced. This will predominantly be in global sectors, mainly in trade and commodity finance,&rdquo; Chief Executive Kees van Dijkhuizen said in a statement. ABN in December last year said it would weigh the future of its corporate bank, as new regulations hurt profitability by requiring banks to hold more capital for assets with a relatively high risk. The cut in corporate activities will reduce the risk-weighted assets on ABN&rsquo;s balance sheet by 5 billion euros  ($5.81 billion) by 2020, the bank said, to 34 billion euros. The division had around 2,600 employees at the end of June and delivered 11 percent of ABN&rsquo;s total net profit in the second quarter. ABN Amro on Wednesday reported a 28 percent fall in second-quarter net profit at 688 million euros ($799.5 million), but beat analysts&rsquo; average expectation in a Reuters poll of 562 million euros.

The Ford Territory, developed with Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) (000550.SZ ) and available in three powertrain choices including a plug-in hybrid version, is intended to close a gap in its China strategy. The new SUV is one of the 50 new or redesigned vehicles Ford has said it plans to launch in China starting this year and through 2025, which include the redesigned Ford Focus car due to hit showrooms later this year.  It will make it possible for Ford to compete with indigenous Chinese automakers such as Geely [GEELY.UL] and Great Wall Motor (601633.SS ) that are pumping out hot-selling compact SUVs with competitive quality and lower price tags. Ford did not discuss on Wednesday a specific pricing strategy for the Territory, but two individuals familiar with the new car said it will likely have a price tag of around 150,000 yuan ($21,990.27). The car puts the company in a segment it has never competed in before and which is witnessing surging demand from smaller, but fast-growing interior cities across China that indigenous Chinese automakers have capitalized on to grow rapidly.     &ldquo;Clearly this&rsquo;s been a difficult year for Ford in China. But this new vehicle is part of our growth plan that will improve our business in China and return us to profitability and set us on a growth trajectory again in China,&rdquo; Ford&rsquo;s Asia-Pacific and China chief Peter Fleet told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.  &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t going to be an instantaneous turnaround of our business in China, but you&rsquo;re going to see a series of actions, a series of products and a series of moves that will return us to being a very successful growth business in China.&rdquo;  SALES SLUMP Ford&rsquo;s business in China has been faltering since last year. Its vehicle sales tumbled 25 percent in the first half of 2018 from the same period a year ago to 400,443 vehicles, which led to a second-quarter pre-tax loss of $483 million for its China operations. According to consultancy LMC Automotive, it was Ford&rsquo;s biggest first-half percentage decline in sales volume since starting operations in China in 2001. Ford blames its weak China business on an aging model lineup that is awaiting an overhaul.  The sales slump is also exacerbated by the impact of China&rsquo;s trade tensions with the United States, a problem that has hit Ford&rsquo;s premium brand Lincoln hard since all Lincoln cars sold now in China are imported from the United States and face a 40 percent tariff Beijing levies on U.S.-made cars in retaliation for U.S. trade actions. PROFITABILITY BOOST Fleet said the new SUV, which will be available in gasoline, so-called mild-hybrid and plug-in hybrid versions, has been designed as an entry vehicle &ldquo;for younger families in emerging cities&rdquo; of China.  The Dearborn Michigan-based car maker needs a product such as the low-priced Territory because the company is &ldquo;running a scale business&rdquo; and needs to expand its market share and revenue base, he said. Ford officials indicated late last month that an array of sport utility vehicles it plans to launch in China next year and in 2020 will give the company what one described as a &ldquo;real boost&rdquo; in China. To compete in the market for low-priced, no-frills cars, Ford&rsquo;s competitors such as General Motors (GM.N ) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T ) have created local China-only brands of their own, such as Baojun and Venucia, respectively.

The Galaxy 7 and other smartphones made by Samsung Electronics (005930.KS ) were previously thought to be immune to a security vulnerability known as Meltdown, which researchers said affected most of the world&rsquo;s PCs, smartphones and other computing devices.      Researchers from Austria&rsquo;s Graz Technical University told Reuters they have figured out a way to exploit the Meltdown vulnerability to attack Galaxy S7 handsets. The team plans to release their findings on Wednesday at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas. They are looking into Meltdown&rsquo;s impact on other makes and models of smartphones and expect to uncover more vulnerable devices in the near future, researcher Michael Schwarz told Reuters. &ldquo;There are potentially even more phones affected that we don&rsquo;t know about yet,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are potentially hundreds of million of phones out there that are affected by Meltdown and may not be patched because the vendors themselves do not know.&rdquo; Samsung said it created a patch to protect Galaxy S7 handsets against Meltdown that it began pushing out to affected users last month. &ldquo;Samsung takes security very seriously and our products and services are designed with security as a priority,&rdquo; the company said in a statement. A Samsung spokeswoman declined to say how many Galaxy S7s were vulnerable to Meltdown attacks.  She said there were no reported cases where Meltdown had been exploited to attack an S7 handset and that no other Samsung phones were known to be vulnerable.  Meltdown, and a second vulnerability known as Spectre, can be exploited to reveal the contents of a computer device&rsquo;s central processing unit - designed to be a secure inner sanctum. Hackers can exploit those vulnerabilities by either bypassing hardware barriers or tricking applications into giving up secret information such as passwords or banking details. There are no known cases of hackers exploiting either vulnerability in a real-world attack, but disclosure of the widespread hardware flaws has rocked the computer industry, forcing chipmakers and device manufacturers to scramble to contain the fallout. The Galaxy S7 is currently used by some 30 million people, according to research firm Strategy Analytics. Samsung has released two new versions of its flagship Galaxy line of smartphones since the S7 debuted in 2016.

Front-month Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were at $74.50 per barrel at 0651 GMT, down 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were at $69.15 per barrel, down 2 cents. China&rsquo;s July crude oil imports recovered slightly in July after falling for the previous two months, but were still among the lowest this year due to a drop-off in demand from the country&rsquo;s smaller independent, or &ldquo;teapot&rdquo;, refineries. Shipments into the world&rsquo;s biggest importer of crude came in at 36.02 million tonnes last month, or 8.48 million bpd, up from 8.18 million bpd a year ago, and just up on June&rsquo;s 8.36 million bpd, data from the General Administration of Customs showed. However, July imports were still the third-lowest so far this year. Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures said on Wednesday that an escalating trade dispute between the United States and China has &ldquo;unnerved investors on the prospect of lowered global oil demand growth.&rdquo; Markets were still supported by the introduction of new U.S. sanctions against Iran on Tuesday, which initially target Iran&rsquo;s purchases of U.S. dollars - in which oil is traded - metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector. From November, Washington will also target Iran&rsquo;s petroleum sector. Iran is the third-largest producer among the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). It shipped out almost 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in September, equivalent to around 3 percent of global demand. Beyond the sanctions, the oil market was focusing on the U.S. market, where the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday that crude inventories fell by 6 million barrels in the week to Aug. 3 to 407.2 million. Official U.S. fuel storage data is due to be released later on Wednesday by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). In terms of production, the EIA on Tuesday slightly cut its 2018 expectation for average 2018 U.S. crude output to 10.69 million bpd, down from its previous estimate of 10.79 million bpd.

Najib and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, were barred from leaving Malaysia after his decade in power ended in a shock election defeat in May, and the new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, relaunched an investigation into 1Malaysia Development Berhad. Dressed in a grey suit, Najib appeared calm as three charges of money laundering were read out at the Kuala Lumpur high court. He pleaded not guilty, and was granted  bail. Najib has also pleaded not guilty to three charges for criminal breach of trust and one charge for abuse of power that were leveled against him last month. The money laundering charges relate to electronic transfers amounting to 42 million ringgit ($10 million) from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit, into Najib&rsquo;s personal bank account. The offense carries a penalty of up to 15 years in jail and a fine of not less than 5 times the value of the proceeds of any illegal transfers, or five million ringgit, whichever is higher. Najib was accompanied by his children as he arrived at the courthouse in a four-car motorcade. He left after the proceedings without speaking to the media. &ldquo;SRC, at the time of the so-called happening, was no longer a part of 1MDB. So it&rsquo;s got nothing to do with 1MDB...,&rdquo; Najib&rsquo;s lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah told reporters outside the court. SRC, created in 2011 by Najib&rsquo;s government to pursue overseas investment in energy resources, was a unit of 1MDB until it was moved to the finance ministry in 2012. When asked if he thinks the case was a witch hunt, Shafee said: &ldquo;My client and I hope that&rsquo;s not the case&rdquo;. High Court Judge Mohamad Nazlan Mohd Ghazali said a decision on when the trial begins, and on a gag order issued last month to stop public discussion of the case, would be made on Friday. PROBE REOPENED The scandal at 1MDB fully erupted in 2015 after media reports that hundreds of millions of dollars from 1MDB were diverted to his personal accounts. Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing, maintaining that those funds were donations from a Saudi royal, and that the bulk of them had been given back. Reopening the investigations into 1MDB after Najib lost power, Malaysian anti-graft officers have revealed how their earlier investigations were obstructed by Najib&rsquo;s government. SRC has been the initial focus of Malaysian investigators as all the suspicious transactions involving it went through Malaysian entities, unlike other 1MDB-related transactions that went through foreign banks and companies. Money allegedly siphoned off from SRC represents only a small fraction of the billions of dollars misappropriated from 1MDB, according to lawsuits filed in the U.S. courts by the Department of Justice which investigated the scandal. DOJ has alleged that an estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates. 1MDB is being investigated by at least six countries, including Singapore, Switzerland and the United States, over alleged money laundering and graft. Slideshow (3 Images)  Earlier this week, Indonesia handed over to Malaysia a $250 million superyacht that had been impounded following claims by the U.S. Department of Justice that it was purchased by fugitive Malaysian financier Low Taek Jho with funds siphoned off from 1MDB.

The world&rsquo;s top iron ore importer bought 89.96 million tonnes of the steel making raw material last month, according to the General Administration of Customs, up from June&rsquo;s 83.24 million tonnes and 88.66 million tonnes in July last year. Shipments for the first seven months of this year fell 0.7 percent from a year ago to 620.65 million tonnes, the customs data showed. China, the world&rsquo;s leading steelmaker, churned out a record 80.2 million tonnes of crude steel last month, just shy of the 81.6 million tonnes the United States produced in whole of 2017. Profit margins at Chinese steel mills have reached near- record levels around 1,100 yuan ($161.24) a ton, supported by ongoing capacity cutting and environmental crackdowns. Demand from traders for iron ore was still strong, especially given an escalating U.S.-China trade row and a weakening yuan, said Cao Ying, chief steel analyst at SDIC Essence Futures. &ldquo;Uncertainties from the external trade situation, especially changes in currency exchange rates amid the trade row between Beijing and Washington, may stimulate demand to replenish supplies before the yuan devalues further,&rdquo; she said, adding that traders had been scrambling to buy imported ore in recent days. The yuan touched a 14-month high of 6.89 against the U.S. dollar CNY= on Monday after China proposed new tariffs on $60 billion of imported goods from the United States. On Tuesday, Washington said it will begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods on Aug.23, heating up the trade spat between the world&rsquo;s top two economies. However, stricter environmental controls have cut restocking demand by mills for iron ore fines, which need to go through a high-polluting sintering process before being used in iron-making blast furnaces. Weekly utilization rates at steel mills&rsquo; blast furnaces across the country slipped last week to the lowest since mid-April, according to the Mysteel consultancy. Several steelmaking cities in Hebei province have also enacted summer production restrictions to curb pollution, while Beijing last week unveiled a draft plan for 28 northern cities in winter, asking steel mills to cut capacity by as much as 50 percent.  Imports of steel products fell 1.3 percent to 1.03 million tonnes, customs data showed. The country bought 7.7 million tonnes of steel products in the first seven months of 2018, which was down 1.1 percent from a year ago.

The Shanghai Composite index .SSEC fell 1.3 percent, and the blue-chip CSI300 index .CSI300 ended 1.6 percent lower, reversing gains made in a recovery in the previous session. Both indexes had posted their biggest daily gains since 2016 on Tuesday, rebounding from four days of heavy losses and raising hopes that their dizzying slide into correction territory may be bottoming. However, stocks returned to the red despite stronger-than-expected July export data on Wednesday, which appeared to show that an earlier round of U.S. tariffs had yet to significantly impact demand for China&rsquo;s goods. &ldquo;China&rsquo;s monetary and fiscal policies have shifted from prudent to growth supportive. The ongoing and protracted trade tension has elevated uncertainties, which prompted more concerns over downside risks to growth,&rdquo; Christy Tan, head of markets strategy and research, Asia, at National Australia Bank, said in a note. Washington said on Tuesday it would begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion in Chinese goods from Aug. 23. These come after it last month slapped tariffs on $34 billion of goods.  The flurry of punitive trade blows from the Trump administration in recent weeks and little sign of compromise from either side have left many investors doubtful of a sustained turnaround for shares in the near term, even with Beijing&rsquo;s pledges to support the economy and pump priming in the financial system. To support growth, Beijing is taking steps to ease financing constraints on borrowers, which have been fueled in part by a multi-year campaign to reduce excessive financial risks and slow a rapid build-up in debt. Last week, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party promised more flexible and effective policy, and authorities are taking steps to offer more credit at cheaper interest rates to small and medium-sized firms which are seen as most vulnerable. On Wednesday, the state planner said China would use monetary policy such as targeted cuts in the reserve requirement ratio for banks to support debt-to-equity swaps this year as it looks to lower corporate leverage ratios. The prospect of such policies weighed on bonds Wednesday, with 10-year Chinese treasury futures for September delivery CFTU8 falling 0.4 percent to 95.620. However, they also offered respite for some investment-intensive companies that were badly mauled in the broad based market selloff in recent weeks China Railway Construction Corp Ltd (601186.SS ), for example, eked out a 0.1 percent gain on Wednesday, a day after jumping the daily 10 percent limit on news the government would boost investment in railways. While stock markets remain fragile, there are signs that authorities are putting a floor under the yuan and discouraging bets on further losses that could trigger capital outflows. The yuan strengthened on Wednesday, as the central bank guided the currency higher with its daily fixing, setting the midpoint of the daily trading band CNY=PBOC at 6.8313 per dollar, 118 pips firmer than the previous fixing of 6.8431. The currency opened at 6.8140 per dollar on the spot market CNY=CFXS and was changing hands at 6.8198 as of 0700 GMT, 80 pips firmer than the previous late session close of 6.8278. The central bank set a reserve requirement ratio of 20 percent from Monday for financial institutions settling foreign exchange forward dollar sales to clients, effectively raising the cost for investors shorting the yuan. While many analysts still expect the currency to test the level of 7 to the U.S. dollar, Ken Hu, chief investment officer for Asia Pacific fixed income at Invesco in Hong Kong, said he maintained a more positive outlook in the longer term. &ldquo;We see limited depreciation pressure on the RMB in the near future and are confident that Chinese regulatory authorities have sufficient tools to manage any exaggerated one-way market move,&rdquo; he said in a note.

That ratio dropped to just below 74 percent at the mid-year point, having started 2018 at about 90 percent. Even that was low, as 100 percent is generally considered the minimum. In the simplest terms it means that without access to borrowing markets or without generating extra reserves, Turkey could in theory default. It needs to refinance around $200 billion a year on average. (GRAPHIC: Turkey's reserves might not cover much either - reut.rs\/2OhrgaI) 2\/RAM BAM The International Monetary Fund is seen as the oracle on currency crises due to its vast experience in trying to put countries&rsquo; finances back together. It has developed a broader gauge it calls the Reserve Adequacy Measure (RAM) which tries to capture the total resources a country has available to meet shocks. On top of the traditional FX and gold reserves, it also takes into account central bank swap lines, sovereign wealth fund ammunition and access to IMF and other protective financing to calculate an overall ratio. The IMF&rsquo;s rule of thumb is that a country&rsquo;s RAM ratio should be between 100 and 150 percent. Turkey&rsquo;s is now below 75 percent having dropped every year since 2013. (GRAPHIC: Turkey's foreign exchange reserves - reut.rs\/2MuuEyM) 3\/UNDERCOVERED Another measure that some experts say is now overly simplistic is the amount of time that a country&rsquo;s reserves would cover the costs of it imports. Turkey is a big energy importer, so in that sense it does have a particular relevance, especially when oil and gas prices are 50 percent higher than they were a year ago and still rising. Three months&rsquo; import cover is typically seen as the lowest safe level. Turkey&rsquo;s figure is currently around five months according to the most recent data, though it will drop rapidly if the lira doesn&rsquo;t stabilize.

The smartphone screen maker, a supplier for Apple Inc, posted a net loss of 1.77 billion yen ($15.91 million) in the first quarter, much lower than a loss of 31.46 billion yen a year earlier. The net loss came in lower than 15.44 billion yen estimated by five analysts in a Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S poll. However, the company&rsquo;s sales dived 45 percent in April-June, as some Chinese smartphone makers have opted for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens. Shipments to Apple have also dropped due to inventory adjustments. &ldquo;Sales are expected to jump about 50 percent in the current quarter (from the last quarter), as production of new (liquid crystal display) panels is ramping up,&rdquo; Chief Financial Officer Takanobu Oshima said. Many rival companies are seen to invest in the mass production of OLED screens, which could leave Japan Display lagging behind as it plans to manufacture smartphone OLED panels only by 2019.  The Japanese screen maker is keen on having a partner who can help finance the launch of a mass production line, which analysts have said typically costs more than 200 billion yen ($1.8 billion). The company did not provide a full-year forecast, although it reiterated that it could swing to a profit this financial year. Meanwhile, markets forecast the company to post a net profit of 2.28 billion yen.

Giovanni Tria said the government estimated the country would grow by 1.2 percent this year, lower than the 1.5 percent previously forecast. He also expected a downward revision of economic output to 1 or 1.1 percent next year from a previous estimate of 1.4 percent. &ldquo;This slowdown would bring the deficit to 1.2 percent in 2019,&rdquo; he said in an interview with newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore. That would be higher than a deficit target of 0.8 percent of gross domestic product drawn up by the previous administration.   Tria added that a clearer estimate of the deficit would be available in September and would depend on the cost of servicing the debt and on the amount of revenues or expenditure cuts that the government will use to avoid an increase of sales taxes.          The worsening economic forecasts could put the new anti-establishment government on a collision course with the European Commission, which monitors the budgets of European Union countries. But Tria, an academic who is seen as more moderate than many of his government partners, said all the reform measures included in the executive&rsquo;s plans were &ldquo;compatible&rdquo; with the commitments Italy had with the EU over its public finances. He said lower growth could slow the reduction of the country&rsquo;s debt, the second highest in the EU after bailed-out Greece, but added that the government maintained the target of bringing the debt down.

Half an hour&rsquo;s drive south of Nazareth, Armageddon is a popular site for the coach loads of tourists visiting the sites of the Holy Land. There is also a busy program of excavations. In 2005, work to expand the aging Megiddo Prison uncovered the remains of a 3rd century Christian prayer hall, including a mosaic referring to &ldquo;God Jesus Christ&rdquo;.     The building with the mosaic was excavated, earlier artifacts found, and the site was covered up under the supervision of archaeologists.  Now, after years of legal and bureaucratic delays, the prison is to be relocated, freeing up the site for further exploration potentially as early as 2021.  The prospect already has archaeologists excitedly talking about an area they have started to call &ldquo;Greater Megiddo&rdquo;.  &ldquo;When the Christian prayer hall was first found beneath the prison, we were all excited for one minute,&rdquo; said Matthew Adams, director of the W.F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem, who has spent years excavating at Megiddo. &ldquo;And then we realized, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s in a maximum security prison, so we&rsquo;ll never actually be able to do anything with it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now that the government has decided to move this prison, we can explore this really amazing and interesting part of the development of early Christianity in a way that we didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d be able to.&rdquo; The prison, whose inmates once included Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants, lies a few hundred yards south of Tel Megiddo itself, the ancient mound at which archeologist have found walls dating back at least 7,000 years. Between the prison and the hill is the largely unexcavated Roman Sixth Legion garrison, thought to have been built by the Emperor Hadrian. The name Armageddon is believed to be a corruption of the Hebrew words Har Megiddo - Mount Megiddo.  Although small, the hill was the site of numerous ancient battles because it overlooks the Jezreel Valley, across which armies have marched since antiquity toward a pass leading to the Mediterranean. The earliest written reference to Megiddo seems to have been during the reign of the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III, who defeated Syrian and Canaanite states there in 1468 BC. It later fell to the Israelites, and then to the Assyrians in 733 BC. In 1918, the British military commander General Edmund Allenby routed Turkish forces there and he later took the title Viscount Allenby of Megiddo and of Felixstowe. But its fame derives principally from the apocalyptic final book of the New Testament, &ldquo;Revelation&rdquo;, which tells of &ldquo;the battle of that great day of God Almighty...And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon&rdquo;. ANCIENT ROAD The current dig at the mound is led by Adams and Prof. Israel Finkelstein, an Israeli archaeologist at Tel Aviv University. &ldquo;Megiddo was important because it sits on the international road which connects Egypt with Mesopotamia, with Damascus, with Anatolia. So whoever sits here controls the most important road of antiquity in the ancient world,&rdquo; Finkelstein said. Their team has used modern radiocarbon dating and laser-assisted distance measurements to precisely date and record the many layers of history on the tel, including monuments once thought to have been built in the era of King Solomon. These, Finkelstein says, can now be attributed to the later era of Ahab, king of the northern kingdom of Israel in the 9th century BC. The most important things was to date things accurately. &ldquo;One way is to date according to Biblical verses, and one way is to date according to radiocarbon studies. Biblical verses, with all due respect, are always problematic because there are questions regarding their author, their goals, the ideology behind the author and so on and so forth.&rdquo; But, he said, &ldquo;when you work with radiocarbon you are on solid grounds in your dating&rdquo;. Israeli tourist authorities are planning a complex on the site to combine tourism, archaeology, and nature hikes. Targeting Christian evangelicals in particular, they hope to draw 300,000 visitors annually, nearly double the current figure. Much work remains. &ldquo;A prison of 1,000 dangerous prisoners will be moved and a new complex will be built in order to expose the mosaic and enable people from all over the world to come,&rdquo; prison service spokeswoman Nicole Englander said. Standing on Tel Megiddo as he supervised excavations into a Middle Bronze Age site, Adams said the area appears to have been a cultural melting pot two millennia ago, with Jews, Christians and pagan Romans all in the same spot.  That suggested interaction between early Christians and the Roman Empire were much more complicated than previously thought. &ldquo;Typically, we think of the Romans persecuting Christians,&rdquo; he said.

Euro zone growth has slowed sharply over the past two quarters, raising fears that the bloc&rsquo;s remarkable expansion, now into its sixth year, may be coming to a premature end.  But the ECB has long argued that the slowdown is due almost entirely to external factors and that domestic demand remains strong and jobs creation appears to be holding up. &ldquo;Private consumption has been the main driver of the recent economic expansion, but there is still scope for further growth,&rdquo; the ECB said. &ldquo;As labor markets continue to improve, consumer confidence should remain elevated and private consumption should rise further.&rdquo; The slowdown comes at a particularly sensitive time for the ECB as it dials back stimulus. It plans to end its 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase scheme by the close of the year, in the hope the economic recovery is strong enough to continue with more modest central bank support.  Employment in the euro zone at over 107 million is record high but unemployment at 8.3 percent is still one full percentage point above the euro zone&rsquo;s pre-crisis mark.  In its bulletin, the ECB argued that recovery in private consumption has so far been weak, particularly for lower income families, whose consumption levels have yet to recover to their pre-crisis level.   Households in the poorest and least educated segments of society, which are now among the main beneficiaries of employment growth, are also more likely to consume non essential items, the ECB said. &ldquo;Losses from the financial crisis have not been recouped everywhere,&rdquo; the ECB said. &ldquo;Private consumption in Germany and France stands about 10 percent higher than before (the recession) but by contrast, consumption in Italy and Spain has not yet recovered completely.&rdquo; Defending its monetary policy against criticism that low rates inflate bubbles, the ECB added that the muted rise in credit growth does not indicate that the consumption boom is fueled by cheap credit. &ldquo;There is little evidence that low interest rates have led to generalized increases in household indebtedness, supporting the view that the overall economic expansion is sustainable,&rdquo; it added.

The dollar has weakened since hitting a three-week high on Monday, when the prospect of a full-blown trade war increased demand for the U.S. currency. Traders said the dollar needed a fresh impetus or an escalation in trade tensions to justify a move higher.  &ldquo;The Chinese trade data, coupled with the PBOC moves, is helping quieten markets, with range-bound trading,&rdquo; said Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at Credit Agricole. &ldquo;The main driver for markets at the moment is dollar buying and selling.&rdquo;  Marinov was referring to the People&rsquo;s Bank of China&rsquo;s imposing a reserve requirement on forex forwards to help stabilize the plummeting yuan. The Chinese currency has since recovered some of its losses and traded up 0.1 percent at 6.8201 CNH=EBS in offshore markets on Wednesday, away from 6.9125 lows hit last week. The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.1618 EUR=EBS, up from Monday's low of $1.1530. The dollar index fell 0.2 percent to 95.036 .DXY. China&rsquo;s July trade data, the first since the United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6, showed China&rsquo;s exports and imports rose faster than expected, although the country&rsquo;s trade surplus with the United States was little changed. In a reminder of the growing trade disputes, however, the U.S. Trade Representative&rsquo;s office said late on Tuesday that the United States would begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of goods it imports from China later this month. The move is the latest by Washington to pressure China into negotiating trade concessions. China has vowed to retaliate to an equal degree. &ldquo;Market reaction to the headlines about the U.S.-China trade war is waning,&rdquo; said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities. &ldquo;If there are clear signs of a slowdown of the U.S. economy due to the tariffs imposed in July, then I think the market will begin to price in slower rate hikes or no rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.&rdquo; YEN GETS BOJ BOOST The yen rose half a percent against the dollar after reports that Bank of Japan board members disagreed last week on how far interest rates should be allowed to move from the central bank's target.

The move comes after the FSA last month issued business improvement orders against a regional lender following revelations it had been engaged in improper conduct, such as charging customers illicit commissions on top of interest on loans due to lack of adequate internal auditing.

The stake purchase in the world&rsquo;s No. 3 lessor is aimed at boosting Orix&rsquo;s presence in the global aircraft leasing market, where demand is expected to grow, supported by a rise in low-cost carriers and passenger traffic, the Japanese firm said on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Orix Corp is pictured in Tokyo, Japan April 7, 2015. Picture taken April 7, 2015.

Orix Aviation is ranked as the world&rsquo;s No. 12 lessor according to fleet size, data from industry consultancy Flightglobal shows. Avolon is currently fully owned by Bohai Capital Holding Co.

The aviation-to-financial services Chinese conglomerate has been shedding assets such as real estate to slash the massive debt it accumulated from its acquisition spree in recent years. It has also started selling aviation-related assets - once considered as core business. HNA bought Avolon for $2.5 billion in 2015 through Bohai. Avolon then struck a deal to buy the aircraft leasing arm of CIT Group (CIT.N ) for $10.4 billion in 2016, creating the world&rsquo;s third-biggest lessor. U.S.-listed AerCap (AER.N ) and General Electric&rsquo;s (GE.N ) GE Capital Aviation Services are the world&rsquo;s top two lessors.

Positive identification by autopsy has yet to be made, but the remains were believed to be those of a 3-year-old boy whose disappearance from his home near Atlanta, Georgia, eventually led to Friday&rsquo;s search of the property, Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe told a news conference. The compound, surrounded by tires and a trench, is located on the outskirts of the rural community of Amalia, New Mexico, near the Colorado state line, about 50 miles (80 km) north of Taos. Hogrefe said the site had been under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for some time as part of its search for the missing boy. The sheriff said he obtained a warrant to search the site after investigators in Georgia received an anonymous tip saying that children inside were &ldquo;starving.&rdquo; The 11 surviving youngsters found there, described by Hogrefe as looking like &ldquo;Third World country refugees,&rdquo; were taken into protective custody by state child welfare authorities. The missing boy&rsquo;s father, suspected of abducting his son, and a second man accused of harboring him as a fugitive, were arrested at the compound the day of the raid, and three women presumed to be the mothers of the 11 children also were detained during the sweep.  The remains of a young boy were found on a return visit to the site on Monday, on what would have been the missing child&rsquo;s fourth birthday, Hogrefe said. CHILD ABUSE CHARGES Each of the five adults has since been charged with 11 counts of felony child abuse, according to the local prosecutor, Donald Gallegos. He said all five were due to make their first court appearance on Wednesday. The boy&rsquo;s father, who the sheriff said was heavily armed when taken into custody, was identified as Siraj Wahhaj, 39. According to CNN, Wahhaj is himself the son of a prominent Muslim cleric of the same name in New York. The second man has been alternatively identified by the sheriff as Lucas Morten and Lucan Morton. The sheriff declined to answer questions about what was going on at the compound, but he said a shooting range had been built at the property. Albuquerque television station KOAT-TV, an ABC affiliate, said the missing boy, named Abdul, was first reported missing by his mother in December after the father left with the child on a supposed trip to a park. Officials in Clayton County, Georgia, said the boy and his father were last seen in Alabama, on Dec. 13, when they were involved in a traffic accident while traveling with five other children and two adults, KOAT-TV reported. The group told an Alabama officer, according to the report, they were headed to New Mexico on a camping trip and were later picked up in a truck registered to Morton.  The boy was reported by his mother to suffer from multiple health issues, including seizures and a brain disorder that prevented him from walking and required regular medication, according to KOAT. In an arrest warrant from Georgia the mother alleged that the father had wanted to perform an exorcism on the boy, but Hogrefe said investigators had no evidence this had occurred. The FBI referred queries from Reuters about the case to the Taos County sheriff.

The monk, Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara, leads the hardline Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) or &ldquo;Buddhist Power Force&rdquo;, which government ministers and Muslims have accused of stirring up violence against Muslims and Christians, allegations he has denied. The court sentenced him to six years&rsquo; rigorous imprisonment over a 2016 incident when Gnanasara interrupted a court hearing on the abduction of the journalist, Prageeth Eknaligoda, in which military intelligence officials were accused. He shouted at the judge and lawyers because the military officials had not been given bail, and threatened Eknaligoda&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;The convict intentionally committed the offence to undermine the judiciary,&rdquo; Preethi Padman Surasena, the president of the court of appeal, said in delivering Wednesday&rsquo;s judgment, adding, &ldquo;Found guilty of all charges beyond reasonable doubt.&rdquo;  The monk was convicted on four counts of contempt of court, receiving terms of four years each on the first and the second counts, six years on the third and five for the fourth, all to run concurrently. A BBS official told Reuters the group would appeal against Wednesday&rsquo;s ruling. &ldquo;We feel there is an attempt by interested parties to have judicial process targeting Gnanasara, therefore, though we do not agree with the judgment, we accept the sentence, and we will appeal,&rdquo; said Dilantha Vithanage, the group&rsquo;s chief executive. Gnanasara, who is being treated in hospital for an ailment, was not in court for the ruling. He has been on bail since filing an appeal against a conviction in a separate case on June 14. In that case, he received two concurrent jail terms of six months, a fine of 1,500 rupees ($9.39), and a compensation payment of 50,000 rupees ($313) for having threatened the journalist&rsquo;s wife, Sandhya Eknaligoda. Since 2014, the monk has faced accusations in cases regarding anti-Muslim violence, hate speech, and defaming the Koran, the Muslim holy book.  That year Gnanasara signed a pact with Myanmar&rsquo;s Ashin Wirathu, who once described himself as &ldquo;the Burmese bin Laden&rdquo;, in what the duo called a bid to counter regional conversion efforts by Islamists.

Euro zone growth has slowed sharply over the past two quarters, raising fears that the bloc&rsquo;s remarkable expansion, now into its sixth year, may be coming to a premature end.  But the ECB has long argued that the slowdown is due almost entirely to external factors and that domestic demand remains strong and jobs creation appears to be holding up. &ldquo;Private consumption has been the main driver of the recent economic expansion, but there is still scope for further growth,&rdquo; the ECB said. &ldquo;As labor markets continue to improve, consumer confidence should remain elevated and private consumption should rise further.&rdquo; The slowdown comes at a particularly sensitive time for the ECB as it dials back stimulus. It plans to end its 2.6 trillion euro bond purchase scheme by the close of the year, in the hope the economic recovery is strong enough to continue with more modest central bank support.  Employment in the euro zone at over 107 million is record high but unemployment at 8.3 percent is still one full percentage point above the euro zone&rsquo;s pre-crisis mark.  In its bulletin, the ECB argued that recovery in private consumption has so far been weak, particularly for lower income families, whose consumption levels have yet to recover to their pre-crisis level.   Households in the poorest and least educated segments of society, which are now among the main beneficiaries of employment growth, are also more likely to consume non essential items, the ECB said. &ldquo;Losses from the financial crisis have not been recouped everywhere,&rdquo; the ECB said. &ldquo;Private consumption in Germany and France stands about 10 percent higher than before (the recession) but by contrast, consumption in Italy and Spain has not yet recovered completely.&rdquo; Defending its monetary policy against criticism that low rates inflate bubbles, the ECB added that the muted rise in credit growth does not indicate that the consumption boom is fueled by cheap credit. &ldquo;There is little evidence that low interest rates have led to generalized increases in household indebtedness, supporting the view that the overall economic expansion is sustainable,&rdquo; it added.

New U.S. sanctions on Iran have taken effect despite pleas from Washington&rsquo;s allies. Iran dismissed a last-minute offer from the Trump administration for talks, saying it could not negotiate while Washington had reneged on a 2015 deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program. Trump decided this year to pull out of the agreement, ignoring pleas from the other world powers that had co-sponsored the deal, including Washington&rsquo;s main European allies, Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China. Beijing has cultivated close commercial links with Tehran, especially in the energy sector. &ldquo;China has consistently opposed unilateral sanctions and long-armed jurisdiction,&rdquo; the Chinese foreign ministry said in a faxed statement to Reuters, responding to questions on the new U.S. sanctions and Trump&rsquo;s threats on firms doing business with Iran. &ldquo;China&rsquo;s commercial cooperation with Iran is open and transparent, reasonable, fair and lawful, not violating any United Nations Security Council resolutions,&rdquo; it added. &ldquo;China&rsquo;s lawful rights should be protected.&rdquo; China, Iran&rsquo;s top oil customer, buys roughly 650,000 barrels a day of crude oil from Tehran, or 7 percent of China&rsquo;s total crude oil imports. At current market rates, the imports are worth some $15 billion a year.  State energy firms CNPC and Sinopec have invested billions of dollars in key Iranian oil fields such as Yadavaran and North Azadegan and have been sending oil to China.  European countries, hoping to persuade Tehran to continue to respect the nuclear deal, have promised to try to lessen the blow of sanctions and to urge their firms not to pull out.  But that has proven difficult, and European companies have quit Iran, arguing that they cannot risk their U.S. business. Few American companies do much business in Iran so the impact of sanctions mainly stems from Washington&rsquo;s ability to block European and Asian firms from trading there. Among large European companies that have suspended plans to invest in Iran are France&rsquo;s oil major Total (TOTF.PA ) and its big carmakers, PSA (PEUP.PA ) and Renault (RENA.PA ).

A woman was pulled alive on Tuesday from under a grocery store that fell apart in the rural north of the tropical holiday island, near the epicenter of Sunday&rsquo;s quake. Rescuers dug through the rubble of a mosque on Wednesday, hoping to reach the aunt of a sprinter who became a national hero last month at the under-20 world championships in Finland. Salama, 52, was at a prayer class in the Karangpangsor village mosque when the quake struck. She is an aunt by marriage of Lalu Muhammad Zohri, who just over a year ago could barely afford running shoes and was hardly known outside his village.

About three-quarters of Lombok&rsquo;s north has been without electricity since Sunday, officials said, and aid workers are finding some hamlets hard to reach because bridges and roads were torn up by the disaster. &ldquo;Teams are speaking of coming across ghost towns, villages that have essentially been abandoned,&rdquo; Matthew Cochrane of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in Geneva on Tuesday.  He added that 80 percent of buildings had been damaged or destroyed, with thousands displaced. Thousands of tourists have left Lombok since Sunday, fearing further earthquakes, some on extra flights provided by airlines and others on ferries to Bali. Officials said that nearly 8,400 tourists and resort workers had been evacuated from the three Gili islands off the northwest coast of Lombok, where two people died, emptying out a destination popular for its white beaches and turquoise waters.

Melissa Delport\/@trufflejournal\/via REUTERS Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes. In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami killed 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia. A woman was pulled alive on Tuesday from under a grocery store that fell apart in the rural north of the tropical holiday island, near the epicenter of Sunday&rsquo;s quake. Rescuers dug through the rubble of a mosque on Wednesday, hoping to reach the aunt of a sprinter who became a national hero last month at the under-20 world championships in Finland. Salama, 52, was at a prayer class in the Karangpangsor village mosque when the quake struck. She is an aunt by marriage of Lalu Muhammad Zohri, who just over a year ago could barely afford running shoes and was hardly known outside his village. The 18-year-old became a household name almost overnight in July, when he won the 100 meters gold at the World Junior Championships in Tampere, Finland. Now he carries the hopes of Indonesia at the Asian Games that the Southeast Asian nation is preparing to host in the next few weeks. He lives two doors away from his aunt&rsquo;s home. Rescuers used a mechanical digger to clear a jumble of metal rods and concrete beside the still-intact green dome of the mosque, but there were no signs that the woman was alive and relatives appeared to have lost hope.

About three-quarters of Lombok&rsquo;s north has been without electricity since Sunday, officials said, and aid workers are finding some hamlets hard to reach because bridges and roads were torn up by the disaster. &ldquo;Teams are speaking of coming across ghost towns, villages that have essentially been abandoned,&rdquo; Matthew Cochrane of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in Geneva on Tuesday.  He added that 80 percent of buildings had been damaged or destroyed, with thousands displaced. Thousands of tourists have left Lombok since Sunday, fearing further earthquakes, some on extra flights provided by airlines and others on ferries to Bali. Officials said that nearly 8,400 tourists and resort workers had been evacuated from the three Gili islands off the northwest coast of Lombok, where two people died, emptying out a destination popular for its white beaches and turquoise waters.

In flagging specific areas of investment, the plan is the first of its kind for the conglomerate and suggests more emphasis than usual on expanding into new segments as its core semiconductor and smartphone businesses show signs of weakness. The investment is also part of a bigger 180 trillion won three-year plan to create jobs and secure fresh revenue streams, providing the first hint of direction for Samsung since group heir Jay Y. Lee was released from jail in February on a suspended sentence following a conviction for bribery. He is appealing the conviction. &ldquo;The total investment size is not surprising. But Samsung can be more active in M&As to do better at AI or 5G, when Lee is fully back to his business,&rdquo; Greg Roh, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities, said. Samsung Electronics said the announcement followed &ldquo;many months of deliberations and review&rdquo; by the group. Samsung Electronics, the world&rsquo;s top maker of memory chips and smartphones and the group&rsquo;s flagship company, did not provide a breakdown of the figures but said it will provide the funds for most of the investment. It said the group plans to significantly expand artificial intelligence (AI) research capability, increasing the number of advanced AI researchers to 1,000 across its global AI centers, and heavily invest in biopharmaceuticals. &ldquo;Samsung has seen strong growth from both its contract manufacturing and biosimilar businesses. It will continue to invest heavily in the businesses, including developing and manufacturing biosimilars,&rdquo; the statement said. The announcement sent shares in contract drugmaker Samsung BioLogics (207940.KS ) up 7 percent. Shares in the group&rsquo;s information technology services affiliate Samsung SDS (018260.KS ) rose nearly 6 percent. Samsung Electronics shares were little changed. The 180 trillion won plan includes capital spending as well as research and development in chips and displays and marks a 6 percent increase from its spending over the past three years. Of the total, 130 trillion won will be spent in South Korea, and is expected to create 40,000 jobs, or 20,000 more than its previous hiring plans, Samsung said. The announcement comes after South Korea&rsquo;s finance minister met Jay Y. Lee on Monday and called for help in job creation, a priority for the country&rsquo;s President Moon Jae-in. Lee has sought to expand Samsung&rsquo;s business into automotive electronics components. He signed off on an $8 billion purchase of U.S.-based Harman International in 2016. But the expansion drive has since stalled after the  political scandal that led to Lee&rsquo;s conviction and a shake up of top management.

Over a decade since floating the idea of Indian expansion, the Swedish retailer will finally mark its entry with a 400,000 square foot (37,160 square meter) store in the southern city of Hyderabad, where it will sell 1,000 items including cutlery and stuffed toys for less than 200 rupees ($2.91). IKEA is pushing into Asia and South America as growth slows in Europe and other traditional markets. It is betting on India with its growing middle class, but mindful of the relatively high pricing that hit sales when entering China and Australia. The firm previously said raising the proportion of locally sourced materials would help it overcome import duties which would otherwise make it challenging to keep prices low.

IKEA has therefore taken the unusual step of setting up a 150-member in-house task force to help with assembly. Overall, the Hyderabad store will directly employ 950 people and another 1,500 indirectly for various services, it said on Wednesday. The firm plans to open more than 25 stores across India by 2025, with the possibility of some being smaller inner-city stores to complement larger suburban locations. It has begun building a store in Mumbai, which it expects to open next summer. So far, IKEA said on Wednesday it has spent half the 105 billion rupees ($1.53 billion) earmarked for India investment, and plans to spend 10 billion rupees setting up each store. LOCAL RIVALS IKEA&rsquo;s competition in India includes startups Pepperfry and UrbanLadder, which offer free delivery and furniture assembled on site at no extra cost. The overall market, however, is dominated by miscellaneous vendors selling ready-made or made-to-order furniture. &ldquo;Even though winning customers in the highly fragmented, untapped and unorganized Indian market will not be easy for the Swedish home furniture giant, it will surely accelerate a shift to organized space (market),&rdquo; market researcher GlobalData said in a note.

The firm plans to open more than 25 stores across India by 2025, with the possibility of some being smaller inner-city stores to complement larger suburban locations. It has begun building a store in Mumbai, which it expects to open next summer. So far, IKEA said on Wednesday it has spent half the 105 billion rupees ($1.53 billion) earmarked for India investment, and plans to spend 10 billion rupees setting up each store. LOCAL RIVALS IKEA&rsquo;s competition in India includes startups Pepperfry and UrbanLadder, which offer free delivery and furniture assembled on site at no extra cost. The overall market, however, is dominated by miscellaneous vendors selling ready-made or made-to-order furniture. &ldquo;Even though winning customers in the highly fragmented, untapped and unorganized Indian market will not be easy for the Swedish home furniture giant, it will surely accelerate a shift to organized space (market),&rdquo; market researcher GlobalData said in a note. GlobalData forecast compound annual growth rate of nearly 11 percent over 2016-2021 in India&rsquo;s furniture and home-improvement market, reaching 4,979.3 billion rupees.

The fundraising comes as the six-year-old firm is considering an initial public offering in Hong Kong next year and has been in talks with investment banks for a multi-billion-dollar listing, two of the sources said.  How successful Bytedance&rsquo;s fundraising is will be an indicator of broader appetite for Chinese investments amid  heightened Sino-U.S. trade tensions and Beijing&rsquo;s debt crackdown that are slowing the Chinese economy and aggravating tight market liquidity. Fast-growing Bytedance runs China&rsquo;s popular news feed Jinri Toutiao and short video platform TikTok, which was also the world&rsquo;s most downloaded app in the first quarter.  Founded by entrepreneur Zhang Yiming in 2012, Bytedance is targeting a valuation of between $70 billion and $75 billion in the latest fundraising, said one of the people.  That would rank it as the world&rsquo;s second-largest &ldquo;unicorn&rdquo; - private firms valued at $1 billion or more, eclipsing ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies [UBER.UL] with a valuation of 68 billion and trailing only Ant Financial which is valued at $150 billion after a June funding round. Bytedance counts venture firm Sequoia Capital, big private equity firms such as KKR, General Atlantic and Hillhouse Capital Group as backers, according to sources, but unlike most Chinese startups, it is independent from China&rsquo;s duo of tech heavyweights - Tencent Holdings and Alibaba Group. Alibaba held talks with Bytedance earlier this year about a potential acquisition or investment, but was turned down by the content aggregator, according to two people with knowledge of the situation.  Tencent, on the other hand, once owned a small stake in the company and later exited, two separate people told Reuters. Bytedance declined to comment. Alibaba and Tencent didn&rsquo;t immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Wall Street Journal first reported about Bytedance&rsquo;s latest fundraising round. Bytedance was seeking a $10 billion valuation in a late 2016 funding round, sources familiar with the fundraising said at the time. About a year ago, the firm was raising at least $2 billion at a valuation of over $20 billion. The valuation exceeded $30 billion earlier this year and as its new video streaming apps such as TikTok gained user traffic, secondary market trading of its shares would value the firm at over $50 billion or $60 billion at times, according to sources familiar with the trades. Bytedance started from news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, or &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s Headlines&rdquo; in Chinese, which uses algorithms and artificial intelligence to select news, online books, videos and other content for readers, with the bulk of its revenue coming from advertising. Since late last year, the firm established another business segment - entertainment, with a number of short video streaming apps and a $1 billion acquisition of popular lip-sync platform Musical.ly, which it shuttered and merged with TikTok last week.     Despite its quick success, the company has faced mounting scrutiny from China&rsquo;s internet censors, with Toutiao temporarily taken off app stores for a cleanup in April while a separate joke app was permanently shut.

A day earlier the authorities said they were looking for Biti in connection with violence following last week&rsquo;s disputed election in which President Emmerson Mnangagwa was declared winner.  Six people were killed in the post-election army clampdown on protests against the result and Mnangagwa&rsquo;s main rival, opposition leader Nelson Chamisa, has accused the government of a security crackdown on his party&rsquo;s members. Biti, whose People&rsquo;s Democratic Party had formed an election alliance with Chamisa&rsquo;s  Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), had been in hiding since last week and had feared for his life, his lawyer Nqobizitha Mlilo said. &ldquo;We have kickstarted processes of seeking political asylum so we are waiting to see how far the processes will go. His life has been in danger,&rdquo; he said. Police have not yet informed him of the charges, Mlilo said. The post-election turmoil was reminiscent of the long rule of Robert Mugabe, who was toppled last November in a de facto military coup and replaced by Mnangagwa. Police spokeswoman Charity Charamba said she had no information on Biti&rsquo;s arrest. The Criminal Investigations Department had said on Tuesday police were looking for Biti, MDC chairman Morgen Komichi and MDC youth leader Happymore Chidziva linked to last week&rsquo;s violence.     Mlilo said Biti was arrested after presenting himself to Zambian immigration officials at Chirundu border post, 350 km north (217 miles) of the capital Harare, where Zimbabwean and Zambian officials share the same building. &ldquo;It seems the Zambian immigration officials alerted the Zimbabwean police and they effected an arrest,&rdquo; said Mlilo who was at the border with Biti.

The monthly Health Cluster Bulletin, published by a group of health-focused aid agencies led by the World Health Organization, said aid workers were bracing for the Idlib battle. &ldquo;Increased hostilities are expected in the North West in the coming period, to result in displacements of 250,000 to over 700,000 people in Idlib and surrounding areas,&rdquo; the report said.  &ldquo;This will cause an increased need for humanitarian assistance to the new vulnerable and host communities, especially emergency health services.&rdquo;  Between mid-June and the end of July, 184,000 people were displaced by a battle in the south and subsequent agreements to end the fighting there.

A Turkish delegation is visiting Washington this week to discuss the friction between the NATO allies, according to reports on Tuesday. But the United States said the two remained at odds on its core demand that Ankara free American evangelical pastor Andrew Brunson. Those tensions have heightened investor concern over Turkey, where investors are most worried by what they see as Erdogan&rsquo;s influence over the central bank, which has not been as aggressive in raising interest rates as investors have hoped.   The president, a self-described &ldquo;enemy of interest rates&rdquo;, wants to see borrowing costs lowered to fuel credit, new construction and growth. The appointment of his son-in-law as finance minister has deepened the concern. &ldquo;The central bank is behind the curve; it remains behind the curve,&rdquo; said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging market strategist at Credit Agricole. &ldquo;The lira keeps depreciating and we are seeing that the central bank is not ready to act.&rdquo; The lira TRYTOM=D3 stood at 5.2925 against the dollar, more than 1 percent weaker on the day. It had gained on Tuesday on reports the delegation would visit Washington. The currency has fallen some 27 percent this year and plunged as much as 5.5 percent on Monday to 5.4250 per dollar, an all-time low and its biggest intraday drop in nearly a decade. That decline came after Washington said it was reviewing access to the U.S. market for Turkey&rsquo;s exports. The cost of insuring exposure to Turkish bank debt rose on Wednesday, with five-year credit default swaps (CDS) for Yapi Kredi up 1 basis point (bp) from Tuesday&rsquo;s close to 460 bps, according to IHS Markit, a record high.  Relations between Turkey and the United States have been strained by differences over Syria and by the trial in Turkey of Brunson, the pastor, for supporting a group Ankara blames for a 2016 abortive putsch. Brunson denies the charge. The United States is also seeking the release from detention of three locally employed embassy staff. Washington last week imposed sanctions on President Tayyip Erdogan&rsquo;s justice minister and interior ministers, saying they played leading roles in organizations responsible for Brunson&rsquo;s arrest. Erdogan has said Turkey would retaliate against the sanctions.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s former deputy campaign manager Rick Gates will take the stand for a third day on Wednesday, after admitting he stole money from his former boss Paul Manafort and helped falsify documents to avoid taxes. Gates, 46, is expected to be cross-examined for about another hour by Manafort&rsquo;s attorney Kevin Downing before prosecutors get a second chance to try and undue some of the possibly damaging testimony he gave during their redirect. Downing on Tuesday spent several hours firing questions at Gates to impugn his credibility and paint him as a liar, asking about everything from his extramarital affair in London and funds he embezzled from Manafort, to questions on whether he may have crossed the line by submitting personal expenses when he worked for Trump&rsquo;s inaugural committee. Gates, who pleaded guilty in Special Counsel Robert Mueller&rsquo;s investigation in February, has testified that he helped Manafort falsify his tax returns, lie to banks to get loans and hide foreign bank accounts that Manafort used to receive payments from oligarchs for political work he did in Ukraine. Manafort&rsquo;s defense team&rsquo;s primary strategy has been to pin much of the blame for financial crimes on Gates, and some observers felt Downing made some headway toward that goal on Tuesday. &ldquo;I think Gates was a very poor witness...I thought he was needlessly evasive and argumentative,&rdquo; said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. Attorney in Michigan who has been watching the trial and said she observed jurors reacting with negative body language as he testified.   However, she added, she still believes the government has a strong chance of winning its case. &ldquo;I think the jury will hate (Gates), but they should still convict (Manafort) because of the testimony of other witnesses and the other documents that do put all of this on Manafort.&rdquo;  Manafort, who served briefly as Trump&rsquo;s campaign manager in 2016, has pleaded not guilty. In the six days since the trial began, the jury has heard from 15 witnesses including two of Manafort&rsquo;s former accountants and his former bookkeeper. All three testified that Manafort and Gates failed to tell them about the foreign holdings in Cyprus. Cindy Laporta, one of the accountants, also testified that Manafort and Gates had used phony loan documents to improperly reduce Manafort&rsquo;s income and lower his tax bill. In detailed testimony this week, Gates has walked prosecutors through the step-by-step process on how he and Manafort doctored and backdated documents.  In one example, Manafort and Gates emailed each other copies of a doctored profit and loss statement they later sent a bank to help Manafort obtain a loan. Gates also admitted, however, that the same tricks he used to help doctor and falsify records for Manafort he also deployed for his own personal gain in order to covertly wire funds out of Manafort&rsquo;s offshore accounts to line his own pockets. Downing seized on those admissions to try and cast doubt on whether the jury can trust Gates&rsquo; claims that he only carried out the fraud alleged by prosecutors at Manafort&rsquo;s behest. Michael Zeldin, a former federal prosecutor, said that in Downing&rsquo;s remaining hour of cross-examination on Wednesday, he needs to keep painting Gates as an unreliable person who cannot be trusted. &ldquo;I think he has to keep hammering at the point that Gates is not a credible witness and he can&rsquo;t be believed,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;The government&rsquo;s case is built around Gates and if you have reason to doubt Gates you have reason to doubt the whole prosecution.&rdquo; "},"d5e03d5abf7b2d9c7d9221618776b511":{"title":"Unlikely pair could usher gun rights case to U.S. Supreme Court","text":"(Reuters) - George Young is a Vietnam War veteran who sued the state of Hawaii three times on his own without a lawyer for the right to carry a handgun, and lost each time.

Kommersant published what it said was the full text of a draft U.S. law outlining possible penalties against Russia. The document here cited potential restrictions on the operations of several state-owned Russian banks in the United States. Republican and Democratic U.S. senators introduced the legislation earlier this month to impose stiff new sanctions on Russia and combat cyber crime, the latest effort by lawmakers to punish Moscow over its alleged interference in U.S. elections and its activities in Syria and Ukraine. The measure&rsquo;s prospects are unclear. It would have to pass both the Senate and House of Representatives and be signed into law by President Donald Trump.  Shares in Russia&rsquo;s largest lender Sberbank (SBER.MM ) dropped to 195 roubles on the Kommersant report, their lowest since mid-April, before pairing losses to 197.2 roubles as of 0940 GMT, down 2.2 percent on the day. Shares in Russia&rsquo;s second-largest bank VTB (VTBR.MM ) were down 1.8 percent, underperforming the benchmark stock index MOEX that declined 1.1 percent to 2,287.9 .IMOEX. Russian business conglomerate Sistema (AFKS.MM ) saw its shares fall 3.5 percent, hit by a threat of targeted sanctions after Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the most senior Representative from Florida, said on her Twitter account on Tuesday that an investigation was underway into Sistema&rsquo;s chairman Vladimir Yevtushenkov for &ldquo;operations in illegally annexed Crimea.&rdquo; Sistema&rsquo;s spokesman said the company had no investments in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The rouble initially shrugged off the risk of more sanctions but soon gave in to selling pressure in thin summer trade. It weakened 1.1 percent to 64.17 RUBUTSTN=MCX to the dollar, the level last seen on June 19. Versus the euro, it eased 1.0 percent to 74.39, its weakest since July 20. EURRUBTN=MCX. &ldquo;The rouble is hit by the sanctions theme. Even though there will be no real action until September, the signal is already there,&rdquo; said a dealer at a major Western bank in Moscow. Reports of new possible sanctions also sparked a sell-off in Russian treasury bonds, known as OFZs, sending their prices lower and lifting their yields.

Under British takeover rules, Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s Fox now has until Sept. 22 to trump Comcast&rsquo;s 14.75 pound per share offer for Sky, which values the broadcaster 25.9 billion pounds ($33 billion), after it formalized its own 14 pounds per share bid. Comcast gatecrashed Fox&rsquo;s attempt to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own earlier this year and the U.S. cable giant&rsquo;s latest, higher offer, which it submitted in July, has been recommended to shareholders by the broadcaster&rsquo;s independent directors. Fox posted its formal offer document, without improving its price, on Tuesday, setting in motion a timetable to end the uncertainty over Sky&rsquo;s future by triggering a 46-day period during which both Fox and Comcast can lift their offers.  If the situation is not resolved by then, Britain&rsquo;s Takeover Panel can run an auction to bring the complex and long-winded transatlantic takeover battle for Sky to an end. However, Fox may opt to walk away from the Sky deal rather than taking on Comcast, people familiar with the matter said. Sky shares were up 1 percent at 15.355 pounds on Wednesday, signaling that investors expect the bidding war to continue. In the document, Fox said it was switching from a scheme of arrangement to an offer. That means it can choose to lower its acceptance threshold from 75 percent of Sky&rsquo;s minority shareholders to a simple majority of all the broadcaster&rsquo;s shares, including its own 39 percent stake.    &ldquo;Flipping to an offer affords Fox more flexibility should they wish to come back with a higher number,&rdquo; analysts at Olivetree Financial said. &ldquo;A scheme is cumbersome as you would constantly need to co-ordinate your actions and intentions with the Sky board.&rdquo; ADVISER PAY Fox also said it expects to pay its advisers, which include Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners, about 242 million pounds if its Sky bid succeeds. Since submitting its first 10.75 pound per share bid for Sky in December 2016, Fox has agreed to sell the bulk of its TV and film assets, including its Sky stake, to Walt Disney (DIS.N ).

Kommersant published what it said was the full text of a draft U.S. law outlining possible penalties against Russia. The document here cited potential restrictions on the operations of several state-owned Russian banks in the United States. Republican and Democratic U.S. senators introduced the legislation earlier this month to impose stiff new sanctions on Russia and combat cyber crime, the latest effort by lawmakers to punish Moscow over its alleged interference in U.S. elections and its activities in Syria and Ukraine. The measure&rsquo;s prospects are unclear. It would have to pass both the Senate and House of Representatives and be signed into law by President Donald Trump.  Shares in Russia&rsquo;s largest lender Sberbank (SBER.MM ) dropped to 195 roubles on the Kommersant report, their lowest since mid-April, before pairing losses to 197.2 roubles as of 0940 GMT, down 2.2 percent on the day. Shares in Russia&rsquo;s second-largest bank VTB (VTBR.MM ) were down 1.8 percent, underperforming the benchmark stock index MOEX that declined 1.1 percent to 2,287.9 .IMOEX. Russian business conglomerate Sistema (AFKS.MM ) saw its shares fall 3.5 percent, hit by a threat of targeted sanctions after Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the most senior Representative from Florida, said on her Twitter account on Tuesday that an investigation was underway into Sistema&rsquo;s chairman Vladimir Yevtushenkov for &ldquo;operations in illegally annexed Crimea.&rdquo; Sistema&rsquo;s spokesman said the company had no investments in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

Johnson, who resigned last month over the way May is negotiating Brexit, wrote in The Daily Telegraph this week that Denmark was wrong to ban the burqa, a head-to-toe cloak which conceals the face with a mesh or is worn in conjuction with the niqab - a face veil that leaves only the eyes exposed.

It was the wrong language to use. He should not have used it,&rdquo; May said. She added that women should be free to wear the burqa if they chose to do so. Full-face coverings such as niqabs and burqas are a polarising issue across Europe, with some arguing that they symbolise discrimination against women and should be outlawed.

Under British takeover rules, Rupert Murdoch&rsquo;s Fox now has until Sept. 22 to trump Comcast&rsquo;s 14.75 pound per share offer for Sky, which values the broadcaster 25.9 billion pounds ($33 billion), after it formalized its own 14 pounds per share bid. Comcast gatecrashed Fox&rsquo;s attempt to buy the 61 percent of Sky that it does not already own earlier this year and the U.S. cable giant&rsquo;s latest, higher offer, which it submitted in July, has been recommended to shareholders by the broadcaster&rsquo;s independent directors. Fox posted its formal offer document, without improving its price, on Tuesday, setting in motion a timetable to end the uncertainty over Sky&rsquo;s future by triggering a 46-day period during which both Fox and Comcast can lift their offers.  If the situation is not resolved by then, Britain&rsquo;s Takeover Panel can run an auction to bring the complex and long-winded transatlantic takeover battle for Sky to an end. However, Fox may opt to walk away from the Sky deal rather than taking on Comcast, people familiar with the matter said. Sky shares were up 1 percent at 15.355 pounds on Wednesday, signaling that investors expect the bidding war to continue. In the document, Fox said it was switching from a scheme of arrangement to an offer. That means it can choose to lower its acceptance threshold from 75 percent of Sky&rsquo;s minority shareholders to a simple majority of all the broadcaster&rsquo;s shares, including its own 39 percent stake.    &ldquo;Flipping to an offer affords Fox more flexibility should they wish to come back with a higher number,&rdquo; analysts at Olivetree Financial said. &ldquo;A scheme is cumbersome as you would constantly need to co-ordinate your actions and intentions with the Sky board.&rdquo; ADVISER PAY Fox also said it expects to pay its advisers, which include Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Centerview Partners, about 242 million pounds if its Sky bid succeeds. Since submitting its first 10.75 pound per share bid for Sky in December 2016, Fox has agreed to sell the bulk of its TV and film assets, including its Sky stake, to Walt Disney (DIS.N ). Comcast had been vying with Disney for the Fox assets but last month dropped its pursuit to focus on buying Sky.

(Reuters) - Five people charged with felony child abuse were due to make their first court appearance on Wednesday after 11 children were found malnourished inside a ramshackle compound in northern New Mexico. The defendants include the father of a missing boy whose disappearance led authorities to raid the compound last week. They also include another man and three women presumed to be the mothers of the 11 children, who were taken into protective custody. On Monday, authorities found a body at the site believed to be the remains of the missing boy, whose abduction from his Georgia home has been reported by his mother in December. His body was discovered on what would have been the missing child&rsquo;s fourth birthday, the Taos County sheriff said on Tuesday. Identification of the remains was awaiting an autopsy. Further charges in the case were possible, local prosecutor Donald Gallegos said. The compound, surrounded by tires and a trench, is located on the outskirts of Amalia, New Mexico, near the Colorado state line, about 50 miles (80 km) north of Taos. Each of the five adults were charged with 11 counts of felony child abuse, according to the local prosecutor, Donald Gallegos. The missing boy&rsquo;s father, who the sheriff said was heavily armed when taken into custody, was identified as Siraj Wahhaj, 39. According to CNN, Wahhaj is himself the son of a prominent Muslim cleric of the same name in New York. The second man has been alternatively identified by the sheriff as Lucas Morten and Lucan Morton. The sheriff declined to answer questions about what was going on at the compound, but he said a shooting range had been built at the property.

The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) said in a joint statement that they needed full access to Rakhine state and were still awaiting permission for international staff to be based in the town of Maungdaw following requests made on June 14. There was no immediate response from the Myanmar authorities to a Reuters request for comment.  The United Nations signed an outline deal with Myanmar in early June aimed at eventually allowing hundreds of thousands of Rohingya in Bangladesh to return safely and by choice. But the secret agreement, seen by Reuters, offers no explicit guarantees of citizenship or freedom of movement throughout the country.  The U.N. agencies said that substantial progress was urgently needed in three key areas: &ldquo;granting effective access in Rakhine State; ensuring freedom of movement for all communities; and addressing the root causes of the crisis&rdquo;. More than 700,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar&rsquo;s western Rakhine state after a military crackdown that started in August last year in response to attacks by ARSA, a Rohingya armed group, on security posts.  Myanmar has rejected accusations of ethnic cleansing and dismissed most accounts of atrocities, blaming Rohingya &ldquo;terrorists&rdquo;. It says it is ready to accept back those who fled. The Rohingya, who regard themselves as native to Rakhine state, are widely considered as interlopers by Myanmar&rsquo;s Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship. The U.N. said that Rohingya remaining in Rakhine are under local orders that severely restrict their freedom of movement, preventing them from reaching jobs, school and health care, and called for these to be lifted.

Half an hour&rsquo;s drive south of Nazareth, Armageddon is a popular site for the coach loads of tourists visiting the sites of the Holy Land. There is also a busy program of excavations. In 2005, work to expand the aging Megiddo Prison uncovered the remains of a 3rd century Christian prayer hall, including a mosaic referring to &ldquo;God Jesus Christ&rdquo;.     The building with the mosaic was excavated, earlier artifacts found, and the site was covered up under the supervision of archaeologists.  Now, after years of legal and bureaucratic delays, the prison is to be relocated, freeing up the site for further exploration potentially as early as 2021.  The prospect already has archaeologists excitedly talking about an area they have started to call &ldquo;Greater Megiddo&rdquo;.  &ldquo;When the Christian prayer hall was first found beneath the prison, we were all excited for one minute,&rdquo; said Matthew Adams, director of the W.F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem, who has spent years excavating at Megiddo. &ldquo;And then we realized, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s in a maximum security prison, so we&rsquo;ll never actually be able to do anything with it.&rdquo; &ldquo;Now that the government has decided to move this prison, we can explore this really amazing and interesting part of the development of early Christianity in a way that we didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d be able to.&rdquo; FILE PHOTO: Ancient Greek inscription mentioning Jesus is seen on a mosaic on the floor of ancient prayer hall that was discovered on the site of Megiddo Prison in northern Israel November 6, 2005. REUTERS\/Ronen Zvulun\/File Photo The prison, whose inmates once included Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants, lies a few hundred yards south of Tel Megiddo itself, the ancient mound at which archeologist have found walls dating back at least 7,000 years. Between the prison and the hill is the largely unexcavated Roman Sixth Legion garrison, thought to have been built by the Emperor Hadrian. The name Armageddon is believed to be a corruption of the Hebrew words Har Megiddo - Mount Megiddo.  Although small, the hill was the site of numerous ancient battles because it overlooks the Jezreel Valley, across which armies have marched since antiquity toward a pass leading to the Mediterranean. The earliest written reference to Megiddo seems to have been during the reign of the Egyptian Pharaoh Thutmose III, who defeated Syrian and Canaanite states there in 1468 BC. It later fell to the Israelites, and then to the Assyrians in 733 BC. In 1918, the British military commander General Edmund Allenby routed Turkish forces there and he later took the title Viscount Allenby of Megiddo and of Felixstowe. But its fame derives principally from the apocalyptic final book of the New Testament, &ldquo;Revelation&rdquo;, which tells of &ldquo;the battle of that great day of God Almighty...And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon&rdquo;. ANCIENT ROAD The current dig at the mound is led by Adams and Prof. Israel Finkelstein, an Israeli archaeologist at Tel Aviv University. &ldquo;Megiddo was important because it sits on the international road which connects Egypt with Mesopotamia, with Damascus, with Anatolia. So whoever sits here controls the most important road of antiquity in the ancient world,&rdquo; Finkelstein said. Slideshow (13 Images)  Their team has used modern radiocarbon dating and laser-assisted distance measurements to precisely date and record the many layers of history on the tel, including monuments once thought to have been built in the era of King Solomon. These, Finkelstein says, can now be attributed to the later era of Ahab, king of the northern kingdom of Israel in the 9th century BC. The most important things was to date things accurately. &ldquo;One way is to date according to Biblical verses, and one way is to date according to radiocarbon studies. Biblical verses, with all due respect, are always problematic because there are questions regarding their author, their goals, the ideology behind the author and so on and so forth.&rdquo; But, he said, &ldquo;when you work with radiocarbon you are on solid grounds in your dating&rdquo;. Israeli tourist authorities are planning a complex on the site to combine tourism, archaeology, and nature hikes. Targeting Christian evangelicals in particular, they hope to draw 300,000 visitors annually, nearly double the current figure. Much work remains. &ldquo;A prison of 1,000 dangerous prisoners will be moved and a new complex will be built in order to expose the mosaic and enable people from all over the world to come,&rdquo; prison service spokeswoman Nicole Englander said. Standing on Tel Megiddo as he supervised excavations into a Middle Bronze Age site, Adams said the area appears to have been a cultural melting pot two millennia ago, with Jews, Christians and pagan Romans all in the same spot.  That suggested interaction between early Christians and the Roman Empire were much more complicated than previously thought. &ldquo;Typically, we think of the Romans persecuting Christians,&rdquo; he said.

The dollar has weakened since hitting a three-week high on Monday, when the prospect of a full-blown trade war increased demand for the currency. Traders said the dollar needed a fresh impetus or an escalation in the trade tensions to move higher.  &ldquo;The Chinese trade data, coupled with the PBOC moves, is helping quieten markets, with range-bound trading,&rdquo; said Valentin Marinov, an FX strategist at Credit Agricole. &ldquo;The main driver for markets at the moment is dollar buying and selling.&rdquo;  The People&rsquo;s Bank of China announced last week that it would impose a reserve requirement on forex forwards and wanted to see a stable yuan. China's currency has since recovered some of its losses but was 0.2 weaker at 6.8380 CNH=EBS in offshore markets, still off last week's 6.9125 lows.

Traders say market sensitivity to trade war headlines has diminished and investors will want to see evidence the dispute is having real impact before they panic. China&rsquo;s July trade data, the first since the United States imposed tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6, showed a faster-than-expected rise in China&rsquo;s exports and imports. The country&rsquo;s trade surplus with the United States was little changed. In a reminder the dispute has not disappeared, however, the U.S. Trade Representative&rsquo;s office said on Tuesday that the U.S. would begin collecting 25 percent tariffs on another $16 billion of Chinese goods later this month. The yen rose half a percent after reports that Bank of Japan board members had disagreed on how far interest rates should be allowed to move from the central bank's target.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 were at $69.35 per barrel, up 18 cents. China&rsquo;s crude imports recovered slightly in July after falling for the previous two months, but were still among the lowest this year due to a drop-off in demand from the country&rsquo;s smaller independent, or &ldquo;teapot&rdquo;, refineries. Shipments into the world&rsquo;s biggest importer of crude came in at 36.02 million tonnes last month, or 8.48 million barrels per day, rising from 8.18 million bpd a year earlier and just up on June&rsquo;s 8.36 million bpd, customs data showed.

From November, Washington will also target Iran&rsquo;s petroleum sector.

ABN Amro said its capital buffers had grown toward the top end of the range deemed necessary for extra shareholder rewards, as second-quarter net profit of 688 million euros ($800 million) comfortably beat analysts&rsquo; forecasts, despite a 28 percent drop.  &ldquo;We feel more confident now than we did three months ago,&rdquo; Chief Executive Kees van Dijkhuizen said, when asked at a news conference about possible higher dividends or share buybacks. &ldquo;We will pay out 50 percent of our sustainable profit as promised, and we&rsquo;ll decide on possible extra shareholder rewards at the end of the year.&rdquo;  ABN Amro had said it would maintain relatively large capital buffers as new banking regulations, dubbed Basel IV, look set to significantly shrink them when they come into effect. Related CoverageABN Amro CEO says more confident about capital for shareholders The bank&rsquo;s core capital adequacy ratio was 18.3 percent at the end of June, up from 17.5 percent three months earlier, near the upper end of the 17.5-18.5 percent range set for this year. That improvement &ldquo;will raise hopes again about higher capital returns&rdquo; for investors, KBC Securities analyst Jason Kalamboussis said in a note. ABN Amro shares were up 3.2 percent to 24.08 euros at 0930 GMT, topping the blue chip AEX index in Amsterdam. JOB CUTS  The impact of Basel IV made ABN Amro, one of the three dominant banks in the Netherlands, decide to cut its international corporate banking activities, as stricter capital requirements limit their profitability. ABN said it would focus its Corporate and Institutional Banking (CIB) division on higher-yielding activities, such as lending to Dutch corporations, clearing and private equity. &ldquo;CIB&rsquo;s financial performance has not been good enough and its growth requires a lot of capital&rdquo;, Van Dijkhuizen said.  To improve profitability, the amount of capital allocated to the division will be reduced, ABN said, mainly limiting trade and commodity finance operations in the offshore energy, diamond and shipping sectors. The bank will cut up to almost 10 percent of the 2,600 jobs at the division, lowering its costs by 80 million euros.   ABN in December said it would assess the future of its corporate bank, as the new banking rules hurt profitability by requiring banks to hold more capital for assets with a relatively high risk. The cut in corporate activities will reduce the risk-weighted assets on ABN&rsquo;s balance sheet by 5 billion euros by 2020, the bank said, to 34 billion euros. ABN was nationalized during the 2008 financial crisis and returned to the stock market in 2015. The Dutch government still holds 56 percent of the bank&rsquo;s shares and hasn&rsquo;t sold any in almost a year.

A right-wing pro-government newspaper has criticized a hugely popular exhibition of her work at the Hungarian National Gallery in Budapest for &ldquo;promoting communism&rdquo;. The criticism comes as part of a wider national debate on culture and cultural policy since nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban won a third consecutive mandate in April.   Orban&rsquo;s supporters and pro-government journalists have argued in the past weeks that after Orban won another strong mandate, it was now time for a shift in culture towards conservative values to end what they call a dominance of leftist-liberal artists. In a July 14 article entitled &ldquo;This is the way communism is promoted using state money&rdquo;, the Kahlo exhibition was listed in the right-wing newspaper Magyar Idok along with some other galleries, artists and exhibitions. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t believe it but Trotsky has emerged in Budapest again, this time from Frida Kahlo&rsquo;s bed,&rdquo; the newspaper wrote, referring to her affair with Leon Trotsky, a key figure in the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, during his later exile in Mexico. Trotsky was assassinated in 1940. Kahlo was affiliated with the communist Party of Mexico and is also said to have decorated the head of her bed with images of communist leaders Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, according to Mexico&rsquo;s Museo Frida Kahlo.

The National Gallery declined comment. Kahlo has become one of the twentieth century&rsquo;s most famous artists in the decades since her death, and her work draws huge interest.

NEW ERA Galvanising the debate about cultural policy, Orban said on July 28 major changes lie ahead in this field and his third election victory was &ldquo;nothing short of a mandate to build a new era.&rdquo; &ldquo;An era is determined by cultural trends, collective beliefs and social customs. This is now the task we are faced with: we must embed the political system in a cultural era,&rdquo; Orban told hundreds of supporters in a landmark speech. A government spokesman declined comment when asked about the looming changes. Slideshow (6 Images)  Since Orban was first elected in 2010, his Fidesz party has rewritten Hungary&rsquo;s constitution, gained control of state media, and businessmen close to Orban and Fidesz have built empires.  Orban has successfully challenged western liberal taboos, winning the 2018 election with a strong anti-immigration campaign and by focusing on the importance of national pride and unity, and a &ldquo;strong Hungary&rdquo;. A group of around 60 artists and art historians signed a manifesto rejecting the listing of artists in Magyar Idok saying the attacks were unfounded. In June, Magyar Idok also published an article by a guest commentator who accused the musical Billy Elliot in the Hungarian State Opera of spreading homosexual propaganda among its young audience. Billy Elliot has been on the program for two years, with over 100,000 viewers so far.  The State Opera canceled 15 of 44 performances planned for June-July.  It said in a statement on its website the performances had not been canceled because of the press controversy. But it noted people had lost interest in seeing the show following the coverage.  Tamas Fricz, a right-wing political analyst who has helped organize mass rallies for Orban, said the aim was &ldquo;not to destroy liberal culture&rdquo; but to adjust the system to reflect the right-wing conservative political dominance, while also preserving the values of liberal arts. &ldquo;The autonomy of individual institutions should be preserved but I think the government ... has the right to firmly and consciously favor and support conservative thinking, artists, works of culture,&rdquo; Fricz said. One way would be to channel more money to historical movies showing the grand chapters of Hungarian history, he said. &ldquo;A conservative culture must build itself ... which would show the historical strength of the Hungarian nation,&rdquo; he said.

Risk and compliance staff are particularly sought after, five of Dublin&rsquo;s leading recruitment consultants told Reuters. Expertise in data science and newer technologies such as payment platforms is also in demand. And upwards pressure on wages could continue, with the central bank expected to approve more firms&rsquo; expansion plans in the coming months. While the higher pay is good news for workers, it can bring concerns for others. International financial firms only account for 2 percent of Irish jobs but have contributed to a sharp fall in the overall jobless rate. The central bank said last week the economy could overheat if capacity constraints emerge in the labor market. &ldquo;Financial services is one of the areas seeing a definite spike in recruitment,&rdquo; said Gerard Murnaghan, vice president at job search site Indeed. Its first-quarter postings were up 15 percent year-on-year. Although Ireland is widely considered the most vulnerable among EU members to any change in trade after Brexit, the financial services firms want to keep close access to clients after Britain leaves the European Union in 2019. Barclays, Legal & General Investment Management and Standard Life Aberdeen are among companies to pick Ireland as a post-Brexit base against stiff competition from rival centers including Luxembourg, Frankfurt and Paris. Robert MacGiolla Phadraig, Sigmar Recruitment&rsquo;s chief commercial officer, said headhunted personnel were securing increases of between 10 percent and 15 percent, with front-office staff able to command the highest salary jumps.  Two thirds of employers surveyed by Sigmar and accounting firm EY earlier this year said they expected to give staff a pay rise in order to stop poaching by rivals, a practice already accounting for one in four hires. &ldquo;We have reached a tipping point.. this is a talent crisis.&rdquo; Local banks Allied Irish Banks (AIBG.I ) and Permanent TSB ILOA.I both said they had lost staff to international rivals in recent weeks, hobbled by a salary cap and ban on share-based remuneration. Around a fifth of vacancies are being filled from abroad and more employers were also offering flexible working to help seal the deal.  Andrew Crawford, head of Experis Ireland, said applicants were coming from as far afield as Australia and the United States, after many had left following the 2008 financial crisis.    &ldquo;WORRYING INDICATORS&rdquo;  Ireland&rsquo;s economy has grown faster than any other in the European Union for the last four years and is forecast to expand by 5.6 percent in 2018 against 2.1 percent for the region. The central bank last week said that fast growth could lead to &ldquo;full capacity&rdquo; in the economy with a risk it overheats and creates a boom-and-bust cycle. But Brexit also brings with it some uncertainty for Ireland. The central bank estimates that if neighboring Britain leaves the EU without a formal divorce agreement in March, it would shave 3.2 percent off economic growth over 10 years, and result in the creation of around 40,000 fewer jobs. An economy is considered at its limit when unemployment is so low that rising wages push up prices. Ireland&rsquo;s jobless rate has dropped sharply in recent months to 5.1 percent, in part due to hiring at fund managers, insurers and foreign-owned banks. Irish business lobby IBEC said it has also seen steep pay rises for specialist positions in other areas such as Ireland&rsquo;s large pharmaceutical and medical device sectors and for IT roles in retail. That was due to faster growth, rather than Brexit, however.   For those hiring, the wage rises can also bring problems. MacGiolla Phadraig said he was worried about the knock-on effect of defensive pay hikes on the competitiveness of the economy, which relies on foreign firms for almost one in ten jobs.  &ldquo;The indicators are honestly quite worrying,&rdquo; he said.      Estelle Davis, managing partner at Brightwater Executive, said she had seen a near-20 percent rise in financial services job vacancies, with almost a quarter of senior roles placed in the second half of 2017 directly attributed to Brexit. HIGHER RENTS The buoyant economy and attractive market outlook was also encouraging ex-pat Irish workers to move back home, she said, particularly for more experienced hires, &ldquo;someone who has 8 years plus senior management experience under their belt&rdquo;. Returnees commanding higher wages nevertheless have to dig a little deeper to find a place to live as property prices, both commercial and residential heat up. While average house prices are still 20 percent below their property bubble peak, they rose 11 percent in Dublin in the year to end-May. Residential rents have already passed the previous peak. That, said Mark O&rsquo;Donnell, a partner working in financial services in the Dublin office of Odgers, was the &ldquo;biggest impediment&rdquo; for some financial services firms. &ldquo;Rents have sky-rocketed and this has already put off potential new entrants.&rdquo; "},"8057df3b198ee6ece2fe1d1bf7f4da4c":{"title":"&#x27;From high season to absolutely nothing&#x27;: Indonesian quake devastates tourism","text":"SENGGIGI, Indonesia\/JAKARTA (Reuters) - Days after a powerful earthquake rocked Indonesia&rsquo;s resort island of Lombok, killing more than 130 people and sending thousands of tourists fleeing, its beach strip stands eerily empty, with shops and hotels shuttered. Any hotels still open are refusing guests out of safety concerns, while nearby restaurants and dive shops lie vacant in what is usually one of their busiest months of the year, reeling from the devastation of tourism caused by the quake. &ldquo;It went from high season just a few days ago to absolutely nothing now,&rdquo; lamented Howard Singleton, who owns a beachside restaurant in the west coast town of Senggigi, ravished by striking sunset views of a volcano on neighboring Bali.  Authorities are still tallying up earthquake losses, but the value of assets destroyed and other damage could easily top 1 trillion rupiah ($69 million), said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.  Foreign and domestic tourists fled after Sunday&rsquo;s earthquake of magnitude 6.9 destroyed homes and displaced tens of thousands of people, adding to the havoc from an earlier quake on July 29, although of smaller magnitude, at 6.4. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had light earthquakes in the past, but never anything like this,&rdquo; said Marcel De Rijk, owner of Lombok boutique hotel chain Puri Mas Resort, whose beachside hotel and villas will stay closed until September for repairs.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost a lot of bookings and future guests are in wait-and-see mode,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think people will choose Lombok anymore this summer.&rdquo; Cancellations of tour bookings for Lombok, Indonesia&rsquo;s second-biggest tourism destination after Bali, have surged, the Association of Indonesian Tours and Travel Agencies told Reuters. &ldquo;I imagine things will be pretty desperate and I don&rsquo;t expect things to improve before next year,&rdquo; said Singleton. Both experts and tourist businesses say Lombok will recover, but the next few months will be tough. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t foresee any long-term tourism impact for Indonesia,&rdquo; said Matt Gebbie, Asia-Pacific director at tourism consultancy Horwarth HTL.

Antara Foto\/Ahmad Subaidi\/ via REUTERS\/File Photo &ldquo;But the short-term impacts are heartbreaking for local communities. Tourism dollars will go a long way in helping the communities rebuild.&rdquo;  &ldquo;NEEDS DOLLARS NOW&rdquo; The quake could not have come at a worse time for President Joko Widodo, who declared last month that Southeast Asia&rsquo;s largest economy &ldquo;needs dollars now&rdquo; and launched a tourism drive to narrow its current account gap and shore up its currency. The rupiah has lost about six percent against the U.S. dollar since the start of 2018, with investors fleeing emerging markets as U.S. interest rates rise and global trade tension rises. Widodo had ordered ministers in July to find ways to build up a tourism sector that is mostly underdeveloped, despite the country&rsquo;s pristine beaches and scenic landscapes. Tourism directly contributed less than 2 percent to Indonesia&rsquo;s economy in 2017, far below Thailand and the Philippines, the World Travel and Tourism Council says. Lombok is one of 10 new destinations, dubbed &ldquo;the new Balis&rdquo;, that Indonesia is developing to help attain Widodo&rsquo;s ambitious\u00a0target of boosting tourism revenues to 8 percent of GDP and attracting 20 million foreign tourists a year.  The disaster may be a jolt to those ambitions, but officials say they are not worried.  Any impact on tourism from the earthquakes will be temporary and will not derail plans for October&rsquo;s IMF-World Bank annual meetings in Bali, Luhut Pandjaitan, the coordinating minister for maritime affairs, told domestic media.  Some Lombok business owners agree. De Rijk pointed to the return of tourists after the 2002 nightclub bombings of Bali in which 202 people died. &ldquo;History shows that even after the worst scenarios ... tourists will always come back. Lombok is such a beautiful place,&rdquo; he said.

The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) said in a joint statement that they needed full access to Rakhine state and were still awaiting permission for international staff to be based in the town of Maungdaw following requests made on June 14. There was no immediate response from the Myanmar authorities to a Reuters request for comment.  The United Nations signed an outline deal with Myanmar in early June aimed at eventually allowing hundreds of thousands of Rohingya in Bangladesh to return safely and by choice. But the secret agreement, seen by Reuters, offers no explicit guarantees of citizenship or freedom of movement throughout the country.  The U.N. agencies said that substantial progress was urgently needed in three key areas: &ldquo;granting effective access in Rakhine State; ensuring freedom of movement for all communities; and addressing the root causes of the crisis&rdquo;. More than 700,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar&rsquo;s western Rakhine state after a military crackdown that started in August last year in response to attacks by ARSA, a Rohingya armed group, on security posts.  Myanmar has rejected accusations of ethnic cleansing and dismissed most accounts of atrocities, blaming Rohingya &ldquo;terrorists&rdquo;. It says it is ready to accept back those who fled. The Rohingya, who regard themselves as native to Rakhine state, are widely considered as interlopers by Myanmar&rsquo;s Buddhist majority and are denied citizenship. The U.N. said that Rohingya remaining in Rakhine are under local orders that severely restrict their freedom of movement, preventing them from reaching jobs, school and health care, and called for these to be lifted.

Traditionally top party leaders visit the town every summer on an unofficial retreat to discuss personnel moves and policy ideas behind closed doors. Li and President Xi Jinping have not appeared on the main evening news since the start of the month, as opposed to almost daily appearances normally, suggesting they may have been in Beidaihe. The government typically does not confirm the Beidaihe meetings are happening, with the only clues coming from state media dispatches datelined Beidaihe about often quite mundane events, rather than describing the leadership discussions. In a brief dispatch, state radio said Li had met United Nations General Assembly President Maria Fernanda Espinosa in Beidaihe, where the two discussed the need to promote free trade, against the backdrop of China&rsquo;s trade war with the United States. Over the weekend, state media had also said Chen Xi, who as head of the Organisation Department oversees the ruling Communist Party&rsquo;s personnel decisions, had been told by Xi to visit &ldquo;vacationing experts&rdquo; in Beidaihe. It said Vice Premier Hu Chunhua had accompanied Chen. Sources with ties to the leadership and foreign diplomats have told Reuters the Beidaihe meeting was likely in early August. Beidaihe, about two hours east of Beijing by high-speed train, is steeped in party history, though sources with ties to the leadership say Xi is not a fan of the place. Its beginnings date from the late 19th century, as a resort for Western missionaries and traders to escape the summer heat, though few buildings from those days still stand. After the communist takeover in 1949, it became a venue for leaders to relax with family and talk in private with peers. The founder of modern China, Mao Zedong, was particularly fond of it, and his calligraphy of a poem he composed there is displayed around the town.

The comments from Beijing and Berlin signaled growing anger from partners of the United States, which reimposed strict sanctions against Iran on Tuesday, over its threat to penalize businesses from third countries that continue to operate there. &ldquo;China has consistently opposed unilateral sanctions and long-armed jurisdiction,&rdquo; the Chinese foreign ministry said. &ldquo;China&rsquo;s commercial cooperation with Iran is open and transparent, reasonable, fair and lawful, not violating any United Nations Security Council resolutions,&rdquo; it added in a faxed statement to Reuters.  &ldquo;China&rsquo;s lawful rights should be protected.&rdquo; The German government said U.S. sanctions against Iran that have an extra-territorial effect violate international law, and Germany expects Washington to consider European interests when coming up with such sanctions. The reimposition of U.S. sanctions followed Trump&rsquo;s decision earlier this year to pull out of a 2015 deal to lift the punitive measures in return for curbs on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program designed to prevent it from building an atomic bomb. Tuesday&rsquo;s sanctions target Iran&rsquo;s purchases of U.S. dollars,  metals trading, coal, industrial software and the auto sector. Trump tweeted on Tuesday: &ldquo;These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in November they ratchet up to yet another level. Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!&rdquo;  EUROPEANS WITHDRAW European countries, hoping to persuade Tehran to continue to respect the deal, have promised to try to lessen the blow of  sanctions and to urge their firms not to pull out. But that has proved difficult: European companies have quit Iran, arguing that they cannot risk their U.S. business. Among those that have suspended plans to invest in Iran are France&rsquo;s oil major Total (TOTF.PA ), its big carmakers PSA (PEUP.PA ) and Renault (RENA.PA ), and their German rival Daimler (DAIGn.DE ). Danish engineering company Haldor Topsoe, one of the world&rsquo;s leading industrial catalyst producers, said on Wednesday it would cut around 200 jobs from its workforce of 2,700 due to the new U.S sanctions on Iran, which made it very hard for its customers there to finance new projects. The chief executive of reinsurance group Munich Re (MUVGn.DE ) said it may abandon its Iran business under pressure from the United States, but described the operation as very small. Turkey, however, said it would continue to buy natural gas from Iran. &ldquo;SIMPLISTIC IDEA&rdquo; In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted by an Iranian newspaper as saying that a U.S. plan to reduce Iran&rsquo;s oil exports to zero would not succeed. U.S. officials have said in recent weeks that they aim to pressure countries to stop buying oil from Iran in a bid to force Tehran to halt its nuclear and missile programs and involvement in regional conflicts in Syria and Iraq. &ldquo;If the Americans want to keep this simplistic and impossible idea in their minds they should also know its consequences,&rdquo; Zarif told the Iran newspaper. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t think that Iran won&rsquo;t export oil and others will export.&rdquo; President Hassan Rouhani hinted last month that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route, if the U.S. attempted to stop the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s oil exports. Trump responded by noting that Iran could face serious consequences if it threatened the United States. &ldquo;The Americans have assembled a war room against Iran,&rdquo; Zarif said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get drawn into a confrontation with America by falling into this war room trap and playing on a battlefield.&rdquo; Iran has dismissed a last-minute offer from the Trump administration for talks, saying it could not negotiate while Washington had reneged on the 2015 deal to lift sanctions. In a speech hours before the sanctions were due to take effect on Tuesday, Rouhani rejected negotiations as long as Washington was no longer complying with the deal. &ldquo;If you stab someone with a knife and then you say you want talks, then the first thing you have to do is remove the knife,&rdquo; Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television.

The comments from Beijing and Berlin signaled growing anger from partners of the United States, which reimposed strict sanctions against Iran on Tuesday, over its threat to penalize businesses from third countries that continue to operate there. &ldquo;China has consistently opposed unilateral sanctions and long-armed jurisdiction,&rdquo; the Chinese foreign ministry said. &ldquo;China&rsquo;s commercial cooperation with Iran is open and transparent, reasonable, fair and lawful, not violating any United Nations Security Council resolutions,&rdquo; it added in a faxed statement to Reuters.  &ldquo;China&rsquo;s lawful rights should be protected.&rdquo; The German government said U.S. sanctions against Iran that have an extra-territorial effect violate international law, and Germany expects Washington to consider European interests when coming up with such sanctions. The reimposition of U.S. sanctions followed Trump&rsquo;s decision earlier this year to pull out of a 2015 deal to lift the punitive measures in return for curbs on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program designed to prevent it from building an atomic bomb. Tuesday&rsquo;s sanctions target Iran&rsquo;s purchases of U.S. dollars,  metals trading, coal, industrial software and the auto sector. Trump tweeted on Tuesday: &ldquo;These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in November they ratchet up to yet another level. Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less!&rdquo;  EUROPEANS WITHDRAW European countries, hoping to persuade Tehran to continue to respect the deal, have promised to try to lessen the blow of  sanctions and to urge their firms not to pull out. But that has proved difficult: European companies have quit Iran, arguing that they cannot risk their U.S. business. Among those that have suspended plans to invest in Iran are France&rsquo;s oil major Total (TOTF.PA ), its big carmakers PSA (PEUP.PA ) and Renault (RENA.PA ), and their German rival Daimler (DAIGn.DE ). Danish engineering company Haldor Topsoe, one of the world&rsquo;s leading industrial catalyst producers, said on Wednesday it would cut around 200 jobs from its workforce of 2,700 due to the new U.S sanctions on Iran, which made it very hard for its customers there to finance new projects. The chief executive of reinsurance group Munich Re (MUVGn.DE ) said it may abandon its Iran business under pressure from the United States, but described the operation as very small. Turkey, however, said it would continue to buy natural gas from Iran. &ldquo;SIMPLISTIC IDEA&rdquo; In Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted by an Iranian newspaper as saying that a U.S. plan to reduce Iran&rsquo;s oil exports to zero would not succeed. U.S. officials have said in recent weeks that they aim to pressure countries to stop buying oil from Iran in a bid to force Tehran to halt its nuclear and missile programs and involvement in regional conflicts in Syria and Iraq. &ldquo;If the Americans want to keep this simplistic and impossible idea in their minds they should also know its consequences,&rdquo; Zarif told the Iran newspaper. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t think that Iran won&rsquo;t export oil and others will export.&rdquo; President Hassan Rouhani hinted last month that Iran could block the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipping route, if the U.S. attempted to stop the Islamic Republic&rsquo;s oil exports. Trump responded by noting that Iran could face serious consequences if it threatened the United States. &ldquo;The Americans have assembled a war room against Iran,&rdquo; Zarif said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get drawn into a confrontation with America by falling into this war room trap and playing on a battlefield.&rdquo; Iran has dismissed a last-minute offer from the Trump administration for talks, saying it could not negotiate while Washington had reneged on the 2015 deal to lift sanctions. In a speech hours before the sanctions were due to take effect on Tuesday, Rouhani rejected negotiations as long as Washington was no longer complying with the deal. &ldquo;If you stab someone with a knife and then you say you want talks, then the first thing you have to do is remove the knife,&rdquo; Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television.

The nomination is expected to end Slovenia&rsquo;s longest political stalemate since an election. The anti-immigrant Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) of former Prime Minister Janez Jansa, the strongest single party in the parliament with 25 seats, could not find a coalition partner to form the government.  Under Slovenian law, lawmakers may nominate candidates for prime minister if the president fails to name a candidate because no party holds a majority in parliament [nL5N1UJ2A5]. The parliament is due to vote on Sarec&rsquo;s nomination on Aug. 17. He would need support of an absolute majority \u2014 at least 46 out of 90 parliamentary members \u2014 to be elected. Sarec is a former actor and comedian whose second term as mayor of Kamnik in northern Slovenia expired this year. His LMS party has agreed a minority coalition with the Social Democrats, the Party of Modern Centre, the Party of ex-Prime Minister Alenka Bratusek SAB and pensioners&rsquo; party Desus. The coalition also expects to get the backing of the Left party, though it earlier said it would not participate in the government. The five parties together hold 43 seats, and with the Left&rsquo;s nine seats they expect to secure a slim majority in the  parliament. If confirmed, Sarec will have 15 days to nominate his cabinet.  One of the first tasks of the new government would be to start the sale of Slovenia&rsquo;s largest bank, state-owned Nova Ljubljanska Banka. Slovenia has committed to sell a 75 percent stake in NLB in exchange for European Commission approval of state aid to the bank in 2013.

The news and information provider reported second-quarter revenue of $1.31 billion, compared with $1.28 billion a year ago. Adjusted for special items, earnings were 17 cents per share, down from 19 cents per share a year ago. Analysts had expected revenue of $1.31 billion and earnings of 11 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I\/B\/E\/S. Thomson Reuters reported a 6-percent decline in operating profit to $204 million, which it said was primarily due to costs and investments ahead of the planned sale of a majority stake in its Financial & Risk business to Blackstone Group LP. Thomson Reuters agreed in January to sell a 55 percent stake in the Financial & Risk unit, which sells data and news primarily to financial customers, to Blackstone. It expects the deal to close early in the fourth quarter.  Blackstone is making its biggest bet since the financial crisis with the $20-billion deal, which pits co-founder Stephen Schwarzman against fellow billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  In the quarter, the Financial & Risk business - now counted as a discontinued operation - grew revenues by 2 percent in constant currency to $1.55 billion.

The Philippines is one of Asia&rsquo;s fastest-growing gambling markets and its integrated casino-resorts have helped create jobs and generate tax and tourism revenue. It also benefits from bans on gambling in many Southeast Asia nations. Duterte on Tuesday ordered a review of Landing&rsquo;s contract on the same day it broke ground on its project, arguing it put the government at a disadvantage because the rental payment was too cheap and the lease too long. He reiterated his longstanding opposition to gambling and said he wanted no new casinos. &ldquo;I hate gambling. I do not want it,&rdquo; Duterte said during a public speech, without elaborating. &ldquo;There will be no casinos outside of what are existing. I am not granting anything.&rdquo; The notoriously blunt Duterte ordered the gaming operator in January to stop accepting new applications in a bid to prevent overcrowding in the sector and manage its growth. At the end of last year, there were nine private casino firms in the Philippines operating 1,444 gaming tables and 9,427 electronic gaming machines, according to government data. Gross gaming revenues rose 11.6 percent to 176.5 billion pesos ($3.33 billion) last year. Since the halt in new applications, two foreign firms, Macau&rsquo;s Galaxy Entertainment Group and Landing, have secured provisional gaming licenses. It was not immediately clear whether other applications submitted prior to January and pending approval would be impacted. Officials of the gaming regulator were not immediately available for comment. Landing said on Wednesday it has nothing to add to its statement issued on Tuesday, which said the integrated resort project was pushing through and its lease contract was valid.

A right-wing pro-government newspaper has criticized a hugely popular exhibition of her work at the Hungarian National Gallery in Budapest for &ldquo;promoting communism&rdquo;. The criticism comes as part of a wider national debate on culture and cultural policy since nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban won a third consecutive mandate in April.   Orban&rsquo;s supporters and pro-government journalists have argued in the past weeks that after Orban won another strong mandate, it was now time for a shift in culture towards conservative values to end what they call a dominance of leftist-liberal artists. In a July 14 article entitled &ldquo;This is the way communism is promoted using state money&rdquo;, the Kahlo exhibition was listed in the right-wing newspaper Magyar Idok along with some other galleries, artists and exhibitions. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t believe it but Trotsky has emerged in Budapest again, this time from Frida Kahlo&rsquo;s bed,&rdquo; the newspaper wrote, referring to her affair with Leon Trotsky, a key figure in the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, during his later exile in Mexico. Trotsky was assassinated in 1940. Kahlo was affiliated with the communist Party of Mexico and is also said to have decorated the head of her bed with images of communist leaders Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, according to Mexico&rsquo;s Museo Frida Kahlo.  A visitor attends the \"Frida Kahlo: Masterpieces from the Museo Dolores Olmedo, Mexico City\" exhibition at the Hungarian National Gallery in Budapest, Hungary, August 2, 2018. REUTERS\/Bernadett Szabo The Kahlo exhibition, the international musical Billy Elliot and a string of gallery shows have found themselves under fire in a series of articles in the newspaper.     The paper added there was &ldquo;no aesthetic problem&rdquo; with the exhibition of the &ldquo;Mexican communist painter&rdquo;, which is drawing up to 3,000 visitors a day. The National Gallery declined comment. Kahlo has become one of the twentieth century&rsquo;s most famous artists in the decades since her death, and her work draws huge interest. The Budapest exhibition of paintings coincides with a Kahlo exhibition at London&rsquo;s Victoria & Albert Museum that focuses on her life story through personal artefacts. NEW ERA Galvanising the debate about cultural policy, Orban said on July 28 major changes lie ahead in this field and his third election victory was &ldquo;nothing short of a mandate to build a new era.&rdquo; &ldquo;An era is determined by cultural trends, collective beliefs and social customs. This is now the task we are faced with: we must embed the political system in a cultural era,&rdquo; Orban told hundreds of supporters in a landmark speech. A government spokesman declined comment when asked about the looming changes. Slideshow (6 Images)  Since Orban was first elected in 2010, his Fidesz party has rewritten Hungary&rsquo;s constitution, gained control of state media, and businessmen close to Orban and Fidesz have built empires.  Orban has successfully challenged western liberal taboos, winning the 2018 election with a strong anti-immigration campaign and by focusing on the importance of national pride and unity, and a &ldquo;strong Hungary&rdquo;. A group of around 60 artists and art historians signed a manifesto rejecting the listing of artists in Magyar Idok saying the attacks were unfounded. In June, Magyar Idok also published an article by a guest commentator who accused the musical Billy Elliot in the Hungarian State Opera of spreading homosexual propaganda among its young audience. Billy Elliot has been on the program for two years, with over 100,000 viewers so far.  The State Opera canceled 15 of 44 performances planned for June-July.  It said in a statement on its website the performances had not been canceled because of the press controversy. But it noted people had lost interest in seeing the show following the coverage.  Tamas Fricz, a right-wing political analyst who has helped organize mass rallies for Orban, said the aim was &ldquo;not to destroy liberal culture&rdquo; but to adjust the system to reflect the right-wing conservative political dominance, while also preserving the values of liberal arts. &ldquo;The autonomy of individual institutions should be preserved but I think the government ... has the right to firmly and consciously favor and support conservative thinking, artists, works of culture,&rdquo; Fricz said. One way would be to channel more money to historical movies showing the grand chapters of Hungarian history, he said. &ldquo;A conservative culture must build itself ... which would show the historical strength of the Hungarian nation,&rdquo; he said.

At least 30 U.S. states have legalized medical marijuana, but none of them make provisions for ailing animals. As a result, veterinarians are reluctant to even discuss marijuana, which remains illegal under federal law, over concerns of putting their professional licenses at risk, said Dr. Jeffrey Powers, chair of the American Veterinary Medical Association&rsquo;s subcommittee on cannabinoids. That leaves it to   pet owners themselves to make life-altering decisions about dosing and duration of the treatment. Change could come soon to California, which appears ready to pass the nation&rsquo;s first law giving veterinarians the legal cover they need to answer questions about using cannabis for pets. &ldquo;A human can get their doctor&rsquo;s advice but a dog can&rsquo;t,  legally. It&rsquo;s bizarre,&rdquo; said Judy Boyle, 62, of Beaver Island, Michigan, whose dog Mac had for years been taking traditional prescription medicines for arthritis and anxiety. The cumulative effect of those drugs was causing Mac&rsquo;s liver to fail. Research on her home computer convinced Boyle in March to instead regularly give her 40-pound (18 kg) Australian Cattle Dog cannabinoid dog chews. Five months later, he&rsquo;s a much calmer yet more energetic dog, and his liver function has returned to normal for the first time in years, Boyle said. The Vet CBD Pet Cannabis Company booth is seen at CatCon in Pasadena, California, U.S. August 5, 2018. REUTERS\/Lucy Nicholson Cannabidiol \u2013 a cannabis plant extract also known as CBD - is the featured ingredient in hemp oils, chews and other pet products that are more popular than ever. CBD is associated with pain relief, as opposed to THC, the ingredient in marijuana which at higher concentrations is associated with euphoric &ldquo;high&rdquo; feelings. Since the federal government still bans cannabis as a controlled substance - and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has vowed to get tough on marijuana - many veterinarians have been warned by their state professional licensing boards not to mention it as a treatment option.  At present, &ldquo;veterinarians are in violation of California law if they are incorporating cannabis into their practices,&rdquo; the state Veterinary Medical Board said in a statement. The same is true in most states. SALES SOAR IN SUMMER Pet lovers, taking matters into their own hands, are snapping up CBD products, according to a 2018 nationwide survey of 1,068 dog owners by Colorado State University veterinary medicine researchers. Nearly 80 percent of respondents said they bought hemp or marijuana products for their dogs. In the non-scientific online survey, pet owners reported that pot products were nearly 44 percent more effective for a dog&rsquo;s pain relief and 41 percent more effective for anxiety than conventional medicines. Clinical research into CBD also is beginning to produce results. Slideshow (4 Images)  Cornell University researchers found CBD increases comfort and activity in dogs with arthritis, according to a study published in July in Frontiers in Veterinary Science. CBD led to a reduction in frequency of seizures in 89 percent of dogs with epilepsy, according to preliminary results of a Colorado State University study released last month. Interest in CBD products has surged this summer, as July Fourth holiday fireworks and thunderstorms trigger severe anxiety for many pets. In second quarter of 2018, Google searches for CBD products for humans and animals was 12 times higher than a year earlier. The biggest jump was in searches for &ldquo;CBD for pets&rdquo; and &ldquo;hemp for pets,&rdquo; GlobalCannabinoids.io, a distributor of hemp-derived cannabinoids, reported this week. Demand for information is so strong that a panel discussion was packed at CatCon, the world&rsquo;s biggest cat-centric event held in Pasadena, California, last weekend. It was titled, &ldquo;Cannabis and Cats: What You Need to Know Meow&rdquo;  &ldquo;I went to my vet and she goes, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t talk about it,&rsquo;&rdquo; said CatCon founder Susan Michals. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an important conversation that needs to be had,&rdquo; Michals said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s scary for people to go on and talk to Dr. Google and try and figure (dosage) if your cat weighs eight pounds or your other cat 16 pounds, will you OD (overdose) them?&rdquo; Julienne Brown, 26, and Jacob Kish, 25, who live in Los Angeles with an overweight Savannah cat named Dude who suffers from arthritis pain, attended the panel discussion. Kish said they will now look into treating Dude with CBD. &ldquo;This is the first I&rsquo;ve heard that this is an option,&rdquo; Kish said. &ldquo;So we&rsquo;re really excited.&rdquo; "},"a51144bc1491f10c932fe141d14e9d7a":{"title":"Turkish delegation to meet with U.S. State Department officials: spokeswoman","text":"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Turkish delegation will meet with top officials from the U.S. State Department on Wednesday, part of a visit to Washington this week to address growing friction between the NATO allies fueled by Ankara&rsquo;s detention of an American evangelical pastor. &ldquo;We can confirm that a Turkish delegation will meet with State Department officials today,&rdquo; U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Wednesday. &ldquo;The meeting will be led by our deputy secretary, John Sullivan.&rdquo;\u00a0 Sullivan, the number two official at State, will host a bilateral meeting with Turkish Deputy Foreign Minister Sedat Onal in the late morning, according to a schedule the department published on Wednesday.

Any hotels still open are refusing guests out of safety concerns, while nearby restaurants and dive shops lie vacant in what is usually one of their busiest months of the year, reeling from the devastation of tourism caused by the quake. &ldquo;It went from high season just a few days ago to absolutely nothing now,&rdquo; lamented Howard Singleton, who owns a beachside restaurant in the west coast town of Senggigi, ravished by striking sunset views of a volcano on neighboring Bali.  Authorities are still tallying up earthquake losses, but the value of assets destroyed and other damage could easily top 1 trillion rupiah ($69 million), said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.  Foreign and domestic tourists fled after Sunday&rsquo;s earthquake of magnitude 6.9 destroyed homes and displaced tens of thousands of people, adding to the havoc from an earlier quake on July 29, although of smaller magnitude, at 6.4. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had light earthquakes in the past, but never anything like this,&rdquo; said Marcel De Rijk, owner of Lombok boutique hotel chain Puri Mas Resort, whose beachside hotel and villas will stay closed until September for repairs.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost a lot of bookings and future guests are in wait-and-see mode,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think people will choose Lombok anymore this summer.&rdquo; Cancellations of tour bookings for Lombok, Indonesia&rsquo;s second-biggest tourism destination after Bali, have surged, the Association of Indonesian Tours and Travel Agencies told Reuters. &ldquo;I imagine things will be pretty desperate and I don&rsquo;t expect things to improve before next year,&rdquo; said Singleton. Both experts and tourist businesses say Lombok will recover, but the next few months will be tough. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t foresee any long-term tourism impact for Indonesia,&rdquo; said Matt Gebbie, Asia-Pacific director at tourism consultancy Horwarth HTL.

Antara Foto\/Ahmad Subaidi\/ via REUTERS\/File Photo &ldquo;But the short-term impacts are heartbreaking for local communities. Tourism dollars will go a long way in helping the communities rebuild.&rdquo;  &ldquo;NEEDS DOLLARS NOW&rdquo; The quake could not have come at a worse time for President Joko Widodo, who declared last month that Southeast Asia&rsquo;s largest economy &ldquo;needs dollars now&rdquo; and launched a tourism drive to narrow its current account gap and shore up its currency. The rupiah IDR= has lost about six percent against the U.S. dollar since the start of 2018, with investors fleeing emerging markets as U.S. interest rates rise and global trade tension rises. Widodo had ordered ministers in July to find ways to build up a tourism sector that is mostly underdeveloped, despite the country&rsquo;s pristine beaches and scenic landscapes. Tourism directly contributed less than 2 percent to Indonesia&rsquo;s economy in 2017, far below Thailand and the Philippines, the World Travel and Tourism Council says. Lombok is one of 10 new destinations, dubbed &ldquo;the new Balis&rdquo;, that Indonesia is developing to help attain Widodo&rsquo;s ambitious\u00a0target of boosting tourism revenues to 8 percent of GDP and attracting 20 million foreign tourists a year.  The disaster may be a jolt to those ambitions, but officials say they are not worried.  Any impact on tourism from the earthquakes will be temporary and will not derail plans for October&rsquo;s IMF-World Bank annual meetings in Bali, Luhut Pandjaitan, the coordinating minister for maritime affairs, told domestic media.  Some Lombok business owners agree. De Rijk pointed to the return of tourists after the 2002 nightclub bombings of Bali in which 202 people died. &ldquo;History shows that even after the worst scenarios ... tourists will always come back. Lombok is such a beautiful place,&rdquo; he said.

The stake purchase in the world&rsquo;s No. 3 lessor will help Orix to bulk up in the $280 billion global aircraft leasing market, where demand is growing, supported by a rise in low-cost carriers and passenger traffic. The agreed deal will allow Orix Aviation Systems Ltd, a fully-owned unit of Orix, to gain part control of a lessor that has 562 aircraft, nearly three times its size. As Orix has no aircraft on order, it can now tap into Avolon&rsquo;s 300-plus aircraft on order with Boeing (BA.N ) and Airbus (AIR.PA ). &ldquo;Big players having access to placement positions over the next number of years and having scale of orders is indeed very important for their success,&rdquo; Jeremy Meyler, deputy CEO of Orix Aviation, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Orix Corp is pictured in Tokyo, Japan April 7, 2015. Picture taken April 7, 2015. REUTERS\/Toru Hanai The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year and Orix will get two seats on Avolon&rsquo;s board. Avolon is currently fully owned by Bohai Capital Holding Co. Ltd (000415.SZ ), which is in turn controlled by HNA. Orix Aviation is the world&rsquo;s No. 12 lessor. Combining the strengths of Orix&rsquo;s asset management platform and Avolon&rsquo;s trading business will help Avolon to grow further, said David Power, CEO of Orix Aviation. HNA bought Avolon for $2.5 billion in 2015 through Bohai. Avolon then struck a deal to buy the aircraft leasing arm of CIT Group (CIT.N ) for $10.4 billion in 2016, creating the world&rsquo;s third-biggest lessor. U.S.-listed AerCap (AER.N ) and General Electric&rsquo;s (GE.N ) GE Capital Aviation Services are the world&rsquo;s top two lessors. Over the past year, Avolon has come under scrutiny over its links to HNA and credit ratings analysts have been pressing for tougher safeguards against it being forced to bail out the cash-strapped Chinese conglomerate. &ldquo;Our new shareholder structure and the associated enhancements to our governance framework will also accelerate our momentum towards an investment grade rating \u2013 a key objective for our business,&rdquo; Domhnal Slattery, Avolon&rsquo;s CEO, said in a statement. The aviation-to-financial services HNA group has been shedding assets such as real estate to slash the massive debt it accumulated from its acquisition spree in recent years. It has also started selling aviation-related assets - once considered as core business. &ldquo;Orix&rsquo;s investment will significantly improve investors&rsquo; confidence in Avolon&rsquo;s financial position and future financing capability for its large number of aircraft on order, easing their concerns given the high financial leverage of HNA Group,&rdquo; said Corrine Png, CEO of transport research firm Crucial Perspective. Orix is a diversified financial services company with  businesses ranging from leasing, life insurance and real estate to corporate lending. It has pursued diversification both in Japan and overseas. Orix was in talks with HNA and Bohai for more than six months and the agreed 30 percent purchase was ideal for now, executives said. &ldquo;Following negotiations with Bohai, clearly that&rsquo;s what was available to purchase as well,&rdquo; said Meyler, adding Orix had no plans currently to raise its stake in Avolon.
