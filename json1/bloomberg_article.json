And North Korea appears to have a Pompeo problem.&#xA0;Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about.SoftBank Weighs $90 Billion Value in Mobile IPOJapanese conglomerate&#xA0;SoftBank Group Corp.&#xA0;is considering seeking a valuation of about  $90 billion for its domestic wireless business in a planned initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter. SoftBank is speaking to advisers about selling a third &#x2013; or about $30 billion &#x2013;&#xA0;of the business in the IPO, the people said. Discussions are preliminary and the final valuation will depend on investors&#x2019; feedback, they said. A $30 billion-IPO would make&#xA0;SoftBank Mobile&#xA0;the largest listing ever, surpassing the $25 billion debut of&#xA0;Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.&#xA0;in 2014.Bitcoin Leads Crypto Retreat                      {\"contentId\":\"PD26D96KLVR501\",\"position\":\"box\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[300,250],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"Mobile Body Box Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"box1\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/five-things-you-need-to-know-to-start-your-day-jkisgxg8\"},\"containerId\":\"box-oN2Me9j\"}                               Bitcoin slipped below $7,000 to its  lowest level in three weeks, as seemingly positive sentiment surrounding the largest virtual currency soured over the weekend. The digital token fell onto the&#xA0;$6,000-handle for the first time since July 17. Last month&#x2019;s renewed exuberance, which saw it rise by almost a third, appears to be fading against the backdrop of a challenging technical picture. A series of lower-highs show how rallies have repeatedly failed to build momentum. The coin fell even in the wake of news that Starbucks Corp. is&#xA0;teaming up&#xA0;with Intercontinental Exchange Inc., which just created a venture designed to more tightly integrate digital currencies into global commerce. Confusion surrounding the news may have spurred a deepening in the decline, which began last Monday.&#xA0;Jamie Dimon&#x2019;s bearish comments on the coin at an event this weekend may have also triggered selling.North Korea&#x2019;s Pompeo ProblemThe  widening gulf&#xA0;between U.S. Secretary of State&#xA0;Michael Pompeo&#x2019;s description of nuclear talks with North Korea and Pyongyang&#x2019;s criticism of his efforts is adding further confusion to the status of negotiations intended to lead to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. Twice in recent weeks North Korean officials and state media have rebutted the top U.S. diplomat&#x2019;s characterization of events and suggested the administration has a myopic focus on denuclearization while ignoring issues such as bringing about a final resolution of the  Korean War. Even as President&#xA0;Donald Trump&#xA0;and North Korean leader&#xA0;Kim Jong Un&#xA0;exchange optimistic messages about their push for peace, Pompeo has increasingly become a target of public disparagement from Pyongyang.Iran Sanctions RestoredThe Trump administration moved to  restore some U.S. sanctions on Iran and reaffirmed plans to impose tougher penalties on the country&#x2019;s oil sales in November, as President Hassan Rouhani comes under increasing economic and political pressure to address the crisis. Trump signed an executive order on Monday restricting purchases of dollar banknotes by Iran, preventing the government from trading gold and other precious metals and blocking the nation from selling or acquiring various industrial metals. The measures, which take effect Aug. 7, also target the auto industry, and will ban imports of Persian carpets and pistachios to the U.S. In a televised address, Rouhani said Iran is open to negotiations if the U.S. is &#x201C;sincere,&#x201D; but he added that such talks would be meaningless while his nation is being hit with sanctions.U.S. Stocks Advance, RBA Looms U.S. stocks rose as&#xA0;strong results from Berkshire Hathaway Inc. lifted financial shares&#xA0;&#xA0;and higher oil prices boosted energy producers.

Flash flooding last month from the failure of an auxiliary dam at a hydroelectricity plant being built along a tributary in southern Laos killed about 30 people. It also caused widespread damage to local economies, leaving at least 6,000 homeless and raising questions about how the river is managed.But the river, made famous in movies and attracting hordes of tourists each year, matters well beyond trade and commerce. Money has poured in as countries, often via state-run or backed companies, compete to built hydro-power plants. For smaller, poorer states like Cambodia and Laos, the investment is welcome, even if it comes with strategic strings attached.                               {\"contentId\":\"PCT5S76KLVR501\",\"position\":\"outstream\",\"dimensions\":{\"large_desktop\":[[1,8]],\"small_desktop\":[[1,8]],\"tablet\":[[1,8]]},\"strategy\":\"always\",\"type\":\"Outstream Video Native Ad\",\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"outstream\",\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/damming-up-the-mekong-comes-with-strategic-strings-for-china\"},\"containerId\":\"outstream-video-1-PCT5S76KLVR501\"}                                            {\"contentId\":\"PCT5S76KLVR501\",\"position\":\"box\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[300,250],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"Mobile Body Box Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"box1\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/damming-up-the-mekong-comes-with-strategic-strings-for-china\"},\"containerId\":\"box-pwJ9qHp\"}                               China, by far the biggest power in the region, and where the Mekong starts up in the Tibetan plateau, is increasingly using its economic clout to secure its broader aims. Greater control over the Mekong -- known as Lancang in China -- through to southern Vietnam gives Beijing a bigger say over the use of the river&#x2019;s key resources, and leverage to press countries to fall into line on its politics.&#x201C;The full brunt of this influence has not yet been demonstrated but, if exercised, it has the power to create famine, civil unrest, and potentially topple governments,&#x201D; said Elliot Brennan, a Bangkok-based research fellow at the Institute for Security &amp; Policy Development.&#x201C;China&#x2019;s increasing influence over the river system, both through upstream dams and joint venture dams on the Lower Mekong, is the other half of its so-called salami-slicing strategy in Southeast Asia,&#x201D; he said referring to the strategy of incremental build-up of a chain of artificial islands, infrastructure and military capability.With China having already built six major dams on the upper part of the river, and with plans to build another 21, its ability to store and release water during the dry season and in times of drought is set to increase. The Mekong is sometimes described by observers as the next geopolitical flashpoint for the region. While it is not at the level of the disputed South China Sea, where China has reclaimed thousands of acres and installed military outposts on tiny rocky outcrops and sandy islets, the Mekong may eventually matter even more. That&#x2019;s because of its value as an arterial waterway to the sea, through the foodbowls of Southeast Asia, where rice and other key crops are farmed, for the fish it carries, and as a tourist destination.                       {\"contentId\":\"PCT5S76KLVR501\",\"position\":\"in-article\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[5,19],[300,250],[1,1]],\"tablet\":[[5,19],[728,90],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"In Article Flex Native Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"in-article\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/damming-up-the-mekong-comes-with-strategic-strings-for-china\"},\"containerId\":\"in-article-GSXZ13p\"}                               In both the Mekong and South China Sea, China is deploying carrots (investment) and sticks (military and diplomatic pressure). While its companies have helped finance the expanding network of dams along the river, China has also sought to maximize its deciding voice on how the entire 2,700 miles (4,350 km) Mekong is run.Jointly established in 1995, the Mekong River Commission was for 20 years the main mechanism for managing the river among Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam. That changed in 2016, when China officially launched the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Mechanism.Rather than work with the Mekong River Commission, which it is not part of, China focused on building the LMCM into a body that helps promote the development of western China, and complements its Belt and Road Initiative of expanding overland and maritime trade routes to Europe. With a membership that includes all mainland Southeast Asian states, the LMCM is broader in scope than the Mekong River Commission. It addresses political and security issues such as health, education and infrastructure as well as the sustainable development of the river and cross-border economic cooperation. It helps manage joint patrols with Chinese military boats.The U.S. meanwhile has focused on the Lower Mekong Initiative, a partnership set up in 2009 to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth among the five Lower Mekong countries. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, at a meeting of the group in Singapore on Friday, cited the Southeast Asian states as key strategic partners.&#x201C;Creating equitable, sustainable, inclusive growth for the sub-region not only contributes to Asean countries and Asean&#x2019;s centrality, but also to a free and open Indo-Pacific,&#x201D; Pompeo said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.The comments were telling. Asean as a group has largely refrained from criticizing China for its actions in the South China Sea. China has insisted it will deal with territorial disputes with Southeast Asian nations on a bilateral basis, not through Asean. And its economic support of Cambodia and Laos in particular gives it sway over those nations in Asean, which makes all its decisions by consensus.China views the LMCM as &#x201C;an important part&#x201D; of cooperation between China and Asean, according to Foreign Minister Wang Yi.Still, &#x201C;one unique feature of the Mekong River is that its geographic span reflects the region&#x2019;s geopolitical hierarchy: a powerful China at the headwaters, smaller less developed nations downstream,&#x201D; said Sebastian Strangio, a Thailand-based researcher who is writing a book on the impact of China&#x2019;s influence in Southeast Asia. &#x201C;You can already see this in the extreme reluctance of downstream nations to say anything critical about China&#x2019;s exploitation of the upper reaches of the Mekong,&#x201D; he said.Chinese investors are bankrolling huge projects downstream, particularly in Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar.&#x201C;The leaders of these smaller, less wealthy countries like Laos and Cambodia feel unable to turn down the investment,&#x201D; said Matt Busch, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute&#x2019;s East Asia program.&#x201C;With the existing governance structures for the Mekong no longer functioning in a collective and effective fashion, we will probably witness more states acting alone to secure what they perceive as their short-term interests.&quot;&#x2014; With assistance by Hannah Dormido"},"7f00b1c95b0dc597926d3008e93a2663":{"category":"markets","header":"Chinese Explorer Cnooc May Reward Investors Even If Oil Won't","str_time":"August 6, 2018, 6:00 PM","key_point":["Explorer\u2019s stock valuation looks cheap against regional rivals","Cnooc is \u2018the essential oil to own,\u2019 Goldman analysts say"],"text":"Chinese offshore oil giant Cnooc Ltd. may have more to offer equity investors betting on the recovery in global crude prices, even if the rally appears to be taking a bit of a breather.The state oil company boasts vast reserve potential and a robust track record in cost cutting -- making it better positioned to tap strong oil prices than most of its regional rivals such as Australia&#x2019;s Woodside Petroleum Ltd., Inpex Corp. of Japan and Thailand&#x2019;s PTT Exploration &amp; Production PCL, according to analysts and data compiled by Bloomberg.Yet Cnooc is still trading at an around 30 percent discount to those peers, partly reflecting investor disappointment over its first-quarter revenue, while also indicating it may have been undervalued. The stock has a potential to gain 29 percent over the next 12 months, the most among Asian oil and gas producers after India&#x2019;s&#xA0;Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corp., according to analysts&#x2019; price targets compiled by Bloomberg.                       {\"contentId\":\"PCVF786TTDS901\",\"position\":\"box\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[300,250],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"Mobile Body Box Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"box1\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/chinese-explorer-cnooc-may-reward-investors-even-if-oil-won-t\"},\"containerId\":\"box-oPbEi7F\"}                               &#x201C;Cnooc is a low-risk play on a bullish oil price view,&#x201D; said Laban Yu, an analyst at Jefferies Group LLC in Hong Kong. The stock is &#x201C;absurdly cheap&#x201D; compared with international majors such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp, he added.Cnooc -- which gets almost all its earnings from exploration and production of oil and gas -- tracks closely crude&#x2019;s rise and fall. Prices have staged a comeback since the 2014-2016 slump, first as OPEC restrained output and more recently amid concern about supply disruptions from suppliers such as Libya, Iran and Venezuela. While there are signs the rally is cooling, benchmark Brent is still more than double its nadir below $30 a barrel, and Cnooc is reaping the benefit as shares and profits rebounded.Cnooc&#x2019;s shares have gained about 12 percent in Hong Kong this year to HK$12.52, extending two annual gains. It currently trades at 8.9 times its forecast 2018 earnings, below the 15.4 for its major peers in the Asia Pacific region. Of the 22 analysts covering the stock, 19 had the equivalent of a buy rating and none called for a sell.The company may post a more than 60 percent surge in first-half net income from a year ago when it reports financial results later this month, according to estimates in a Bloomberg survey. In the past year, Cnooc&#x2019;s earnings growth have trounced 93 percent of its regional peers, and 79 percent in terms of sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Even as prospects for further gains in crude are limited, the company&#x2019;s cost cutting and higher spending on exploration and production projects will probably bolster earnings. Cnooc&#x2019;s all-in cost has declined every year since 2013 to $32.54 per barrel of oil equivalent last year, according to its annual reports.                       {\"contentId\":\"PCVF786TTDS901\",\"position\":\"in-article\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[5,19],[300,250],[1,1]],\"tablet\":[[5,19],[728,90],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"In Article Flex Native Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"in-article\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/chinese-explorer-cnooc-may-reward-investors-even-if-oil-won-t\"},\"containerId\":\"in-article-ztsJCDU\"}                               The Beijing-based explorer is targeting capital expenditure of between 70 billion and 80 billion yuan ($10.2 billion to $11.7 billion) this year, the highest since 2014. It&#x2019;s also aiming to produce 500 million barrels of oil equivalent by the end of the decade, with 42 percent coming from overseas, from 469 million barrels last year.Cnooc&#x2019;s proved reserves -- a gauge of future earnings potential -- rose by a quarter to about 4.84 billion barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2017. Its reserves are set to expand further, largely due to contribution from the Stabroek Block in Guyana, the world&#x2019;s biggest new deepwater project in which Cnooc has a 25 percent stake.Exxon, operator of the project, raised estimates of its discovery by 25 percent, saying last month the find could now produce 4 billion barrels of oil. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has cited reserves from the project as reasons for its buy rating on Cnooc.&#x201C;We still see Cnooc as the essential oil to own in the sector,&#x201D; Goldman&#x2019;s Hong Kong-based analysts including Mark Wiseman wrote in a July 29 note, adding that the Guyana discovery is overlooked. The bank will seek an update from the company on its reserve life and progress of international projects at its first-half results release.Naturally, with Cnooc&#x2019;s fortunes so wedded to oil, any potential slump in prices could hurt its shares. Citigroup Inc. has outlined a scenario where the company&#x2019;s shares may slide to HK$11.80 if Brent were to fall to $45 a barrel next year. The reverse holds true as well: should oil climb to $85, Cnooc would jump to HK$19.90, Citigroup said in a July 19 note.So far this year, the global benchmark has traded at about $72. Brent is expected to average $66 next year, according to the median estimate of eight forecasts compiled by Bloomberg in the past month.&#x201C;Cnooc has underperformed the China oil sector average on concerns of lower production volume guidance and reserve writedowns,&#x201D; Citigroup said in the note. &#x201C;With these concerns behind us, and with the company&#x2019;s excellent cost control track record and strong cash flow position, the stock looks well positioned to outperform.&#x201D;&#x2014; With assistance by Matt Turner","inner_url":[{"title":"Cnooc Ltd.","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/883:HK","type":"company"},{"title":"regional rivals","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/883:HK","type":"company"},{"title":"disappointment","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/terminal\/P7HC8Y6TTDSZ","type":"other"},{"title":"Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corp.","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/ONGC:IN","type":"company"},{"title":"Exxon Mobil Corp.","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/XOM:US","type":"company"},{"title":"reports financial results","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/883:HK","type":"company"},{"title":"targeting","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-02-01\/cnooc-aims-for-highest-spending-in-four-years-amid-oil-recovery","type":"article"},{"title":"proved reserves","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/terminal\/P6DTLH6TTDS6","type":"other"},{"title":"estimates of its discovery","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/terminal\/PCBPPH6JTSEN","type":"other"}]},"30b1dc4a285fa95570145322c1beeab8":{"category":"markets","header":"Asian Stocks Drift; Treasuries, Dollar Steady: Markets Wrap","str_time":"August 6, 2018, 6:05 PM","key_point":["S&P 500 ends at highest since January after Berkshire results","U.S. 10-year yields hold below 3%; Turkish lira advances"],"text":"Asian stocks drifted Tuesday as risk appetite remained subdued and the earnings season continued.

He&#x2019;d gone from an eager photocopier salesman with an obsessive evening-and-weekends video game habit to the chief executive officer at a professional video-game-playing company that generates&#xA0;millions of dollars a year in sponsorships. In 2017, he committed more than $30 million in investment funds buying a spot in two of the world&#x2019;s top esports leagues, where pro video gamers compete in front of huge audiences. Now&#xA0;those Silicon Valley investors expect&#xA0;him to turn his team, Cloud9, into a global entertainment business. So, this April, searching for clues as to how he might do that, Etienne flew to New Orleans to experience WrestleMania 34.He watched the wrestling, but he also wanted to see how the executives guided advertisers through this strange world. One afternoon, Etienne took his seat at the WWE&#x2019;s Business Partner Summit.&#xA0;There, a wrestler named Elias strummed a guitar and performed an ode to brands. In fewer than two minutes, Elias name-checked KFC, Snickers, YouTube, Snapchat, Mattel, Old Spice, NBC, Sony and China&#x2019;s PPTV. It was a sales master class. Etienne saw that the WWE knew how to hold advertisers&#x2019;&#xA0;hands, inculcating them in the appeal of their crazy characters under the guise of a business update. The WWE had figured out how to turn fake wrestling into a business worth $6.1 billion. Like the WWE did with professional wrestling decades ago, Etienne is fighting to convince major companies that his oddball fan base has just as much money to spend as other sports lovers. If the WWE could persuade rich guys that young men watching other men perform dramatized violence was a good investment, so could Etienne.&#xA0;                       {\"contentId\":\"PD1D8J6JIJUP01\",\"position\":\"box\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[300,250],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"Mobile Body Box Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"box1\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/can-this-man-make-his-video-gaming-team-a-1-billion-business\"},\"containerId\":\"box-Rhj1Shl\"}                               There are early signs of Cloud9&#x2019;s promise. Last year, Etienne convinced the WWE,&#xA0;along with some of the technology world&#x2019;s top investors, that video game competitions were worth their money. Peter Thiel&#x2019;s venture capital firm, Founders Fund, and Craft Ventures wrote him the biggest checks, with more funds coming in from former&#xA0;Facebook Inc. executive Chamath Palihapitiya and Reddit Inc.&#xA0;co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Altogether they poured $28 million into Cloud9, the team Etienne founded in 2013&#xA0;by buying a group of League of Legends players out of their contracts for less than $20,000.Cloud9, C9 for short, is the most popular esports team in North America, according to Nielsen Esports, a market research group. The team, based in Santa Monica, California, has hundreds of wins playing more than a dozen video games. Cloud9 has a roster of more than 70 players, many of them living in team-owned dormitory-style housing, earning anywhere from a few thousand dollars a week to hundreds of thousands a year playing video games professionally. Can Etienne be the first person to turn his team into a $1 billion&#xA0;business? &#x201C;There is no founder like Jack in all of esports,&#x201D;&#xA0;said Brian Singerman, who led Founders Fund&#x2019;s investment in Cloud9. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s the type of person people like to work for and play for. And he just works like crazy and loves what he does.&#x201D;But there are many hurdles ahead for Etienne. For one, there&#x2019;s the money: He spent millions to buy his way into a select group of teams that can compete in the top gaming tournaments, and there&#x2019;s no guarantee it&#x2019;ll recoup that cost. Cloud9 and other teams are working together with game developers to secure lucrative distribution rights for online streaming and television. Cloud9 is also working to land valuable marketing deals. There&#x2019;s also the pressing challenge of making esports easier to watch so people besides hardcore gamers can understand what&#x2019;s going on. In addition to all that, Etienne couldn&#x2019;t stop worrying about Sneaky.&#xA0;&#xA0;                      {\"contentId\":\"PD1D8J6JIJUP01\",\"position\":\"in-article\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[5,19],[300,250],[1,1]],\"tablet\":[[5,19],[728,90],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"In Article Flex Native Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"in-article\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/can-this-man-make-his-video-gaming-team-a-1-billion-business\"},\"containerId\":\"in-article-Ros2ILZ\"}                               People have been playing video games competitively since the invention of the arcade in the early 1970s. In the late 1990s, the strategy game StarCraft and the shooter Counter-Strike were mainstays at neighborhood LAN (local area network) parties. Friends lugged their desktop computers over to whoever&#x2019;s parents had the nicest house and battled it out in the early morning hours. As the internet sped up, video games moved online. In 2004, the science-fiction shooting game Halo 2 and the fantasy game World of Warcraft revolutionized what it looked like to play video games online with friends. In those halcyon days, people who took their games seriously trekked to small tournaments to compete for bragging rights and token prize money. Today, the best players in the world play 14 hours a day and can make decent to spectacular money. Sneaky, a moppy-haired gamer whose real name is Zachary Scuderi, is one of them. He&#x2019;s among Etienne&#x2019;s star players. Cloud9 pays him well above $100,000 a year, though it won&#x2019;t say exactly how much, and he makes many tens of thousands on his own from people paying to watch his stream on Twitch, Amazon.com Inc.&#x2019;s video game streaming network. Sneaky has earned more than 85 million views on Twitch by making gaming look easy, but Etienne was starting to worry that his star had lost his focus.While Sneaky coasts through life on his extraordinary ability to click quickly, earning fans with his slacker,&#xA0;every-man charm, Etienne buzzes with energy, having muscled his way to the top of the gaming industry with the sheer force of his personality. At Xerox Corp., Etienne, a burly, bearded, friendly-faced man, sold large printers, photocopiers and other services to law firms and insurance companies. Despite the tedium, he excelled. His experience selling that most corporate of items&#x2014;a few years after the characters in Office Space took a baseball bat to the printer\/copier&#x2014;taught him how to pitch just about anything.But it was the time he spent outside of work in the mid-2000s that would be the guiding force in his life. Every night, Etienne obsessed over World of Warcraft, and he eventually began recruiting players for his top-ranked guild&#x2014;a group of dozens of players who worked together to slay monsters and harvest precious weapons. &#x201C;I was always out there looking at current talent,&#x201D;&#xA0;Etienne said. He signed copy machine deals during the day and secured elite dragon slayers by night. &#x201C;There was no money involved. It was competitive, and it mattered a lot to me,&#x201D;&#xA0;he said. Growing tired of his day job, Etienne spent a lot of time on Curse, a gamer tip site. After seeing a posting for a sales position there, Etienne landed the job. A year later, he jumped ship to Crunchyroll, an anime streaming site, to build a sales team. (One of his friends on World of Warcraft introduced him to the CEO.) He generated $16 million in sales during his last year at the company, he said. A couple years into that job, one of the people who bought advertising space from Etienne told him that he should help out a then 17-year-old kid named Andy Dinh. Etienne and Dinh would go on to become powerbrokers in the esports world&#x2014;and rivals. But at first, they were friends. Dinh had created a website called SoloMid that had guides on how to play League of Legends&#x2019; dozens of different characters. The site was growing more popular than he knew what to do with. Etienne started giving him advice and then helping him sell ads on the side. SoloMid&#x2019;s advertising quickly climbed from $3,000 a month to $80,000 and kept growing from there, Etienne said. &quot;Jack helped sign some of our very first partners,&quot; Dinh said.&#xA0;&quot;Jack listens, he&apos;s smart, he&apos;s emotionally intelligent and I learned a lot from him.&#x201D;&#xA0;&#xA0;Etienne signed on to manage Dinh&#x2019;s team, called Team SoloMid, in 2011. Eventually, Etienne&#x2019;s boss told him to quit the side gig. Etienne did&#xA0;but soon regretted it. Within months, he decided to quit his day job instead and form his own team.In&#xA0;2013, he spent $23,000 on a five-player team of professional League of Legends players with a small following. Soon, he had a mutiny on his hands. The players had wanted one of their friends to buy them, and so instead of fighting, Etienne arranged a sale&#xA0;and then bought the contracts of another group of players. The team chose a new name: Cloud9.Sneaky was 19 years old and had just moved to Los Angeles from Boca Raton, Florida, to try making it as a professional. He shared a room with three other gamers and was making $500 a month.&#xA0;After buying the team, Etienne took on a parental role for some of the players, especially younger ones like Sneaky. When he moved the team to San Jose, California,&#xA0;Etienne picked up Sneaky from the airport. The owner rented an apartment for the team to live in&#xA0;and kept the fridge stocked. When the players clogged the toilet, Etienne brought them a plunger. That summer, in 2013, Sneaky and his teammates went on a surprise run and made it to the League of Legends championships. Etienne got more than his money&#x2019;s worth. A&#xA0;winning team made signing sponsors much easier. The culmination of the following&#xA0;season, in 2014, was bittersweet. Cloud9 lost 3-to-2&#xA0;to Dinh&#x2019;s Team SoloMid. League of Legends is a war between two teams of five players each. The winner is decided by which team&#x2019;s archer, mage, monster, warrior and healer can work together to murder their enemies and destroy their opponents&#x2019;&#xA0;base. To be a dominant force in League of Legends, you need to be really good at clicking and typing quickly and precisely, while predicting your opponent&#x2019;s movements and coordinating with your team. It requires incessant practice. To watch Sneaky play League of Legends is to watch someone transform the game&#x2019;s most vulnerable characters into powerful opponent-destroyers. It&#x2019;s satisfying to watch someone do it so effortlessly. Millions of people watch Sneaky play for hours on Twitch while he delivers a dour running monologue. &#x201C;The main reason I started streaming more was because I talked to Jack with the team, and we were actually wanting higher salaries,&#x201D;&#xA0;Sneaky said.&#xA0;Etienne suggested they make extra cash on Twitch, where spectators could pay him for advice on in-game weapons and characters, Sneaky said. He&#x2019;s required to plug Cloud9&#x2019;s sponsors from time to time, and that&#x2019;s why his legions of fans are so important to the team. When the U.S. Air Force Reserve ran ads during his Twitch stream last year, Sneaky would stand up and salute, earning many lulz from his fans.                       {\"contentId\":\"PD1D8J6JIJUP01\",\"position\":\"outstream\",\"dimensions\":{\"large_desktop\":[[1,8]],\"small_desktop\":[[1,8]],\"tablet\":[[1,8]]},\"strategy\":\"always\",\"type\":\"Outstream Video Native Ad\",\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"outstream\",\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/can-this-man-make-his-video-gaming-team-a-1-billion-business\"},\"containerId\":\"outstream-video-1-PD1D8J6JIJUP01\"}                                                     {\"contentId\":\"PD1D8J6JIJUP01\",\"position\":\"outstream\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[1,8]]},\"strategy\":\"always\",\"type\":\"Outstream Video Native Ad\",\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"outstream\",\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/can-this-man-make-his-video-gaming-team-a-1-billion-business\"},\"containerId\":\"outstream-video-2-PD1D8J6JIJUP01\"}                               Under Etienne, Sneaky quickly became the cornerstone of Cloud9. While Sneaky won game after game, Etienne recruited top players around him&#x2014;and he secured investors to buy their way into the top League of Legend competition. Over the years, other players came and went. But Sneaky remained, and that was good for business.For months, Etienne grew convinced that Sneaky was taking an increasingly lackadaisical approach while playing with his teammates. And in June, Etienne had had enough, announcing he was benching Sneaky along with two other top players. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re looking for players to always be hungry,&#x201D; Etienne said. Sneaky&#x2019;s public reaction was muted. He began playing on Cloud9&#x2019;s second-tier team with the promise that he could try to earn his way back onto the main team. On Twitter, the team posted this message: &#x201C;No one said it was easy being a C9 fan. We appreciate everyone who sticks with us regardless of what changes are made.&#x201D;&#xA0;The message: Cloud9 is bigger than any one player.The same month that Etienne demoted Sneaky, he announced a major business deal with Red Bull,&#xA0;and soon its logo was plastered all over the team&#x2019;s jerseys. A national advertiser was betting on Cloud9.In June, Etienne held a meeting with his investors modeled after the WWE. Thirty top executives showed up to one of his team houses in Burbank, California, to get an update on the business. They eagerly boarded a bus to the Blizzard Arena nestled between Warner Bros. and Walt Disney studios&#xA0;to watch a Cloud9 team play Overwatch, a game where friendly-faced, gun-wielding avatars blast each other to bits over a small plot of land. Cloud9 won&#xA0;and a month later, won the national tournament broadcast on ESPN. Meanwhile, with Sneaky off the premier League of Legends team, Cloud9 lost four out of five games at the start of the season.

At one point, Arpaio looked downward at the toy and pointed his finger for emphasis as he argued that guns were an effective means of defense.                                {\"contentId\":\"PD27FW3V280002\",\"position\":\"outstream\",\"dimensions\":{\"large_desktop\":[[1,8]],\"small_desktop\":[[1,8]],\"tablet\":[[1,8]]},\"strategy\":\"always\",\"type\":\"Outstream Video Native Ad\",\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"outstream\",\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/arpaio-speaks-to-toy-doughnut-in-new-baron-cohen-s-show\"},\"containerId\":\"outstream-video-1-PD27FW3V280002\"}                                            {\"contentId\":\"PD27FW3V280002\",\"position\":\"box\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[300,250],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"Mobile Body Box Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"box1\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/arpaio-speaks-to-toy-doughnut-in-new-baron-cohen-s-show\"},\"containerId\":\"box-m94p2QO\"}                               The 86-year-old retired lawman joins defeated Senate candidate Roy Moore and other politicians who were pranked in the Showtime series. The Republican served as metro Phoenix&apos;s sheriff for 24 years until his defeat in 2016 as he faced a criminal contempt of court charge for disobeying a judge&apos;s orders in an immigration case. He was later convicted of the misdemeanor, but was spared a possible jail sentence when he was pardoned by President Donald Trump. Arpaio, through his campaign manager, declined an interview request Monday from The Associated Press about the segment. His campaign issued a statement saying Arpaio couldn&apos;t fully understand what Baron Cohen was saying during the interview. &quot;We&apos;re not mad about it, it&apos;s comedy,&quot; Arpaio spokeswoman Jennifer Lawrence said in the statement. In an interview three weeks ago, Arpaio said the segment was filmed in Los Angeles in October, three months before he announced that he was running for the U.S. Senate seat held by retiring Sen. Jeff Flake.                       {\"contentId\":\"PD27FW3V280002\",\"position\":\"in-article\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[5,19],[300,250],[1,1]],\"tablet\":[[5,19],[728,90],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"In Article Flex Native Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"in-article\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/arpaio-speaks-to-toy-doughnut-in-new-baron-cohen-s-show\"},\"containerId\":\"in-article-p6DvErU\"}                               Arpaio said the producers told him the show was focusing on the most famous people in the United States. He also had said he didn&apos;t know who Baron Cohen was until he recently saw news coverage about the comedian pulling a similar prank on former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. The campaign of former state Sen. Kelli Ward, one of Arpaio&apos;s two GOP opponents, declined to comment on Arpaio&apos;s appearance on the show. A spokeswoman for his other opponent, Rep. Martha McSally, didn&apos;t return a phone call and email seeking comment. Baron Cohen, whose character sported reddish orange hair and a garish floral-print shirt, also told Arpaio he has more than 43 guns.                       {\"contentId\":\"PD27FW3V280002\",\"position\":\"outstream\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[1,8]]},\"strategy\":\"always\",\"type\":\"Outstream Video Native Ad\",\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"outstream\",\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-06\/arpaio-speaks-to-toy-doughnut-in-new-baron-cohen-s-show\"},\"containerId\":\"outstream-video-2-PD27FW3V280002\"}                               &quot;You have 43 guns?&quot; Arpaio asked. &quot;Yes, I have been collecting them for the upcoming race war,&quot; Baron Cohen said. Arpaio appeared surprised by the answer, but no further reaction from him was shown during the four-minute segment. He previously said he began to suspect something was amiss when Baron Cohen started using sexually explicit expressions, though he resisted the urge to walk out. Lawrence said in her statement that she had to explain to Arpaio what Baron Cohen meant when he used one such expression."},"afa8b4bd77157e89ae7bd5ec3f950e3f":{"category":"technology","header":"SoFi Is Said to Report Second-Quarter Loss of $200 Million","str_time":"August 6, 2018, 4:00 AM","key_point":["Company had significant adjusted EBITDA losses, people say","Startup reported more than $3 billion in funded loan volume"],"text":"Writedowns of underperforming loans drove Social Finance Inc. to a second-quarter adjusted loss of about $200 million, according to people familiar with the matter.The student-loan refinancer, which has been trying to transform itself into a broader online financial-services company, took a one-time charge on loans originated before the second quarter, one of the people said.

I&apos;m not talking about last week&apos;s social media stock price plunge. It&apos;s the ritualization of Gamergate-style uproar and dishonest brigading that has me disillusioned with the platform.I know soul-searching about Twitter is a bit of a journalistic trope at this point, since we all seem to be simultaneously enraptured with and disgusted by the constantly whirring news machine. But this week&apos;s latest Twitter brouhaha seemed different&#x2014;and reflects ominously not just on Twitter as a platform but on the state of online debate.After Sarah Jeong was announced as a new member of the New York Times editorial board, right wing culture warriors surfaced what they deemed to be&#xA0;racist tweets by her. In July 2014, she tweeted, &quot;Oh man it&apos;s kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men&quot; and in November 2014, she tweeted, &quot;#CancelWhitePeople.&quot; Fox helpfully aggregated some of&#xA0;her controversial tweets.&#xA0;                               {\"contentId\":\"PCVT8D6JIJVA01\",\"position\":\"outstream\",\"dimensions\":{\"large_desktop\":[[1,8]],\"small_desktop\":[[1,8]],\"tablet\":[[1,8]]},\"strategy\":\"always\",\"type\":\"Outstream Video Native Ad\",\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"outstream\",\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-03\/beware-of-the-twitter-mob\"},\"containerId\":\"outstream-video-1-PCVT8D6JIJVA01\"}                                            {\"contentId\":\"PCVT8D6JIJVA01\",\"position\":\"box\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[300,250],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"Mobile Body Box Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"box1\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-03\/beware-of-the-twitter-mob\"},\"containerId\":\"box-nVArcRb\"}                               Jeong tried to grab the reins of the controversy engulfing her by making a statement.&#xA0;She posted&#xA0;two tweets she had received from trolls. One read, &quot;If I saw you. I would sock you right in your lesbian face.&quot; She wrote, &quot;I engaged in what I thought of at the time as counter-trolling. While it was intended as satire, I deeply regret that I mimicked the language of my harassers.&quot; Meanwhile, the&#xA0;Times&#xA0;said it was standing by her but said her tweets &quot;only served to feed the vitriol that we too often see on social media.&quot;Is there anything else on Twitter besides vitriol?Quinn Norton, the online thinker, distilled the problem presciently in 2013, when she wrote about context collapse. She explained,&#xA0;&quot;One of the major problems with online space is that the wrong people see us hanging out with our friends&#xA0;and suddenly decontextualize our actions. This makes them wholly different and often unintended actions.&quot; Norton, of course, had her offer to work at the&#xA0;Times&#xA0;rescinded earlier this year over her own controversial tweets.In this case, it wasn&apos;t that Jeong was bantering among friends online so much as that she had a more confrontational online persona than is tolerated at the&#xA0;Times. She wrote smart, in-depth articles and aggressive tweets. Anyone who read those tweets in conjunction with her work understood that this was deeply thoughtful person who wasn&apos;t going to be bowed by trolls&#x2014;not an actual anti-white bigot (if such a thing can exist). As a white person who has read her work and her tweets over the years, it&apos;s hard to see how anyone could plausibly believe that she literally wanted to cancel white people.The most charitable interpretation of the uproar then is that she pushed the bounds of civil discourse too far. At least some of the Twitter brigades going after her don&apos;t seem to feel much obligation to be intellectually honest about their critique. One Twitter user&#xA0;quipped, &quot;Welcome to the popular new game Is There A Sarah Jeong Critic Who Hasn&apos;t Tweeted Something Racist?&quot; That person dug up examples of Jeong&apos;s critics who themselves had posted xenophobic tweets.                      {\"contentId\":\"PCVT8D6JIJVA01\",\"position\":\"in-article\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[5,19],[300,250],[1,1]],\"tablet\":[[5,19],[728,90],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"In Article Flex Native Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"in-article\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-03\/beware-of-the-twitter-mob\"},\"containerId\":\"in-article-ehbh2mM\"}                               In 2014, Deadspin published a piece titled, &quot;The Future of The Culture War Is Here, And It&apos;s Gamergate.&quot; It&apos;s still&#xA0;worth a read. The piece argues that the media, understandably eager to be fair to all sides of an issue, tends to take all online criticism&#x2014;including anonymous tweets&#x2014;as coming in good faith and is therefore susceptible to being manipulated. &quot;What we&apos;re seeing now is a rehearsal, where the mechanisms of a toxic and inhumane politics are being tested and improved.&quot;This article also ran in Bloomberg Technology&#x2019;s&#xA0;Fully Charged&#xA0;newsletter.&#xA0;Sign up here.And here&#x2019;s what you need to know in global technology newsApple became the first $1 trillion company in the U.S.&#xA0;Its valuation is on par with the gross domestic product of Indonesia.

He got it wrong, at least for the day.The Japanese game maker reported earnings that beat estimates and sent shares climbing as much as 7 percent in Tokyo trading. Plotkin&#x2019;s hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, based in New York, was short about $400 million worth of Nintendo&#x2019;s stock, according to the latest regulatory filing on Tuesday. Trading volumes ahead of earnings indicate it&#x2019;s unlikely he closed the position, resulting in paper losses of as much as $27 million from Wednesday&#x2019;s share surge.The quarterly beat is the latest chapter in the battle between Nintendo and short sellers like Plotkin, which has gripped executives, investors and analysts. Considered one of Japan&#x2019;s hottest stocks as recently as May, shares then fell as much as 27 percent as hedge funds began betting against it. Traders and analysts said they&#x2019;ll be closely watching daily regulatory filings in Japan to gauge if the latest results were enough of a trigger to make short-sellers cover their positions.                      {\"contentId\":\"PCRHMC6K50Y001\",\"position\":\"box\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[300,250],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"Mobile Body Box Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"box1\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-01\/hedge-fund-manager-plotkin-takes-a-hit-as-nintendo-stock-surges\"},\"containerId\":\"box-XRC7v7R\"}                               Short-selling interest was at 2.5 percent of outstanding shares as July 31, according to data from Markit Securities. That implies Plotkin&#x2019;s position accounted for about a third of all shorts on Nintendo.Plotkin is still likely in-the-money on his short bet. The average price of his position is probably around 41,000 yen to 42,000 yen, according to regulatory disclosures and Bloomberg calculations that assume he began short selling in early May. That&#x2019;s still higher than Wednesday&#x2019;s intraday price of 39,330 yen, despite the day&#x2019;s rally. Any potential losses from the trade are also likely a small dent for Plotkin&#x2019;s hedge fund, which oversees about $7 billion and takes long and short positions in consumer stocks. But losses could be amplified if he has held onto to his bullish bet on Electronics Arts Inc., which has tumbled after reporting poor earnings last week. It was Melvin Capital&#x2019;s second largest long position as of March 31, based on the latest U.S. regulatory filings.Plotkin and Melvin Capital&#x2019;s Chief Operating Officer David Kurd did not respond to requests for comment.Analysts have said shorting Nintendo and buying U.S.-based game companies like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard Inc. has been a popular pair trade recently among hedge funds. Microtransactions, esports and releasing games across multiple platforms including mobile has benefited U.S publishers over the past year, lifting shares to all-time highs. Nintendo has been slower in embracing those trends, raising questions if it could fall behind in the industry.                      {\"contentId\":\"PCRHMC6K50Y001\",\"position\":\"in-article\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[5,19],[300,250],[1,1]],\"tablet\":[[5,19],[728,90],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"In Article Flex Native Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"in-article\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-01\/hedge-fund-manager-plotkin-takes-a-hit-as-nintendo-stock-surges\"},\"containerId\":\"in-article-ueQwHvM\"}                               &#x2014; With assistance by Kurt Schussler","inner_url":[{"title":"Nintendo Co.","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/7974:JP","type":"company"},{"title":"Melvin Capital Management","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/1245804D:US","type":"company"},{"title":"$400 million","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-07-30\/sac-alum-plotkin-makes-a-massive-short-bet-against-nintendo","type":"article"},{"title":"quarterly beat","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-07-31\/nintendo-earnings-tops-estimates-on-robust-video-game-sales","type":"article"},{"title":"poor earnings","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/terminal\/PCJ2SP6JIJUO","type":"other"},{"title":"all-time highs","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-07-12\/video-game-stocks-rise-to-records-stoked-by-esports-elation","type":"article"}]},"e8ab4d5ab6100873bb1e4de651ad5728":{"category":"technology","header":"Sony Jumps to Decade High as PlayStation Drives Higher Forecast","str_time":"July 31, 2018, 2:05 AM","key_point":["Game titles for PS4 including God of War drive earnings","Spotify\u2019s recent debut also propped up its bottom line"],"text":"Sony Corp. jumped to its highest in more than a decade after raising its outlook for the current fiscal year, thanks to robust sales of the PlayStation 4 console and profits from its stake in recently listed Spotify Technology SA.Shares rose as much as 5.4 percent in early Tokyo trading, heading for their highest close since 2008, after the company lifted its full-year net income and revenue forecasts and also sharply beat operating profit estimates for the June quarter.&#x201C;Sony secured a big beat on all fronts,&#x201D; Atul Goyal, an analyst at Jefferies Group, wrote in a report. &#x201C;The Games segment had a spectacular quarter with God of War success.

That should come as a relief to investors, who were caught flat-footed in April when new Chief Executive Officer Kenichiro Yoshida unveiled a pessimistic full-year forecast, sending shares tumbling. The stock has recovered since as investors grew more optimistic about Sony&#x2019;s prospects.The PlayStation unit was again the standout. Its revenue climbed 36 percent during the quarter and operating profit nearly quintupled, riding stronger-than-expected sales of new games including God of War and Detroit: Become Human.

That means consumers who bought the devices over the past year or so aren&#x2019;t bored, and weren&#x2019;t&#xA0;lured to smartphone platforms to the extent many feared.New mobile versions of PUBG and Fortnite, both distributed by Tencent Holdings Ltd., raised the specter of gamers spending more time on the ubiquitous smartphone rather than more luxurious but&#xA0;less convenient consoles. Both titles can&#xA0;be thought of as gaming versions of the &#x201C;Hunger Games&#x201D; plot, and are addictive (confession: I&#x2019;m a mobile PUBGer).&#xA0;                      {\"contentId\":\"PCQ31F6JTSEF01\",\"position\":\"box\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[300,250],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"Mobile Body Box Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"box1\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/view\/articles\/2018-07-31\/nintendo-and-sony-both-win-battle-royale\"},\"containerId\":\"box-KEO1csd\"}                               If gamers are indeed trading in console time for mobile time, it&#x2019;s not yet showing up in the numbers at Sony and Nintendo.&#xA0; A crucial metric to watch is digital download ratios. At Sony, 43 percent of all full-game software units were bought via downloads, the same proportion as in the prior quarter and higher than a year earlier. At Nintendo, 24.2 percent of dedicated video-game software sales were digital, also unchanged from the prior period and substantially higher the same quarter of 2017. While one advantage of digital over physical is a relatively low distribution cost, the real benefit comes from removing&#xA0;the friction to spending. Consumers who sign up for an account and connect a credit card are more likely to spend on impulse.&#xA0;That&#x2019;s one of the great benefits of smartphone gaming, and one that has attracted the ire of regulators.With both companies likely to boost their&#xA0;promotion of&#xA0;subscription services &#x2014;&#xA0;Sony with PlayStation Plus and Nintendo offering Switch Online &#x2014;&#xA0;we&#xA0;could see increased loyalty and time-on-platform.

Carlson and his team at the biotechnology startup Recombinetics had made a small tweak in the genetic code of dairy cattle in an attempt to prevent the animals from growing horns. Now, that edited DNA was being copied over to the cells in fetuses growing in their surrogate mothers.&#xA0;No one had tried this before, so it wasn&#x2019;t clear it would work. And compared with the mere days it takes for the cutting-and-pasting of genes to complete in culture dishes, the months-long pregnancies were agonizingly slow. &#x201C;You hope everything is going well,&#x201D; Carlson says. &#x201C;You&#x2019;re expecting it to come out without any horns or horn buds, but you just don&#x2019;t know.&#x201D; As is common with cloned animals, most of the embryos never made it. But Buri and Spotigy, two calves born in April 2015, were free of the telltale bumps that eventually sprout into horns. That meant they would be spared the fate of millions of U.S.-raised cattle, whose horns are destroyed with a hot iron or toxic paste shortly after they&#x2019;re born or are sheared off when they&#x2019;re older. It&#x2019;s a practice Carlson knows his own father, a farmer, struggled with. The painful procedure is done to prevent the cows from goring one another or their human overseers, but People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and other animal-welfare groups vociferously oppose it. (PETA isn&#x2019;t a big fan of gene editing either, which the organization considers animal experimentation.)                      {\"contentId\":\"PC3VOF6KLVRV01\",\"position\":\"box\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[300,250],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"Mobile Body Box Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"box1\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-07-19\/this-scientist-uses-gene-editing-so-cows-won-t-grow-horns\"},\"containerId\":\"box-9jOxJBc\"}                               Scientists like Carlson&#x2014;who are manipulating DNA to not only improve animal welfare, but create better crops and treat human disease&#x2014;are one of the hottest commodities today in biotechnology. U.S. job postings for the profession surged 64 percent over the last two years, according to the job search site Indeed.com.&#xA0;People like Carlson can do this work thanks to two methods, both discovered less than a decade ago, that have made gene editing cheaper and&#xA0;easier. (The technique used to develop Carlson&#x2019;s hornless cows is called TALEN; the more famous one, which came slightly later, is called CRISPR.) Carlson is now involved in several projects that employ gene editing in animals, including one that keeps pigs from reaching puberty so they need not be castrated. His profession is the focus of the second episode of Bloomberg&#x2019;s&#xA0;mini-documentary series Next Jobs, which profiles careers of the future. Carlson first became fascinated with genetics as a high school student, when his father started planting genetically modified corn. &#x201C;They were taller. They didn&#x2019;t have any problems standing up. They were essentially the best crop that I ever saw my dad produce,&#x201D; recalls Carlson, who went on to get his PhD in animal sciences with an emphasis in biotechnology and molecular genetics. &#x201C;From that moment on, I was like, &#x2018;This technology is for real. It can really make a difference.&#x2019;&#x201D;&#xA0;Before scientists like Carlson change the world, they&#x2019;ll need to persuade the government as well as a skeptical public that gene editing is safe. In the U.S., the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration have taken different stances on the issue. The former has been hands-off; the latter proposed guidelines in 2017 that would treat gene editing in animals as a kind of drug, and therefore would require companies to seek approval introducing altered animals to the food supply.&#xA0;Neither Spotigy nor Buri is alive today. The former was slaughtered last year so scientists could examine his meat (it was normal). Buri was euthanized last month, but not before becoming a father to six horn-free calves. One, named Princess, is female. She should be old enough in a little more than a year&#xA0;to have her own calves and start producing milk. Recombinetics plans to examine the milk for signs of abnormalities.&#xA0;                       {\"contentId\":\"PC3VOF6KLVRV01\",\"position\":\"in-article\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[5,19],[300,250],[1,1]],\"tablet\":[[5,19],[728,90],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"In Article Flex Native Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"in-article\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-07-19\/this-scientist-uses-gene-editing-so-cows-won-t-grow-horns\"},\"containerId\":\"in-article-2l1asj2\"}                               Carlson is so confident about the milk&#x2019;s safety he says he wouldn&#x2019;t hesitate to feed it to his three children. Jennifer Kuzma, co-director of the Genetic Engineering and Society Center at North Carolina State University, is more cautious. She notes that gene editing tools sometimes slip up by making insertions or deletions in unintended parts of the genome (Carlson&#x2019;s team looked for these so-called off-target events and found none). Cloning the cells, which is often an essential process in gene editing, can also produce abnormalities, she says.&#xA0;Kuzma also says there needs to be a broader conversation about the underlying ethics of the technology. &#x201C;With these genetic engineering techniques becoming easier to implement and more powerful too, we&#x2019;re at a critical point where things could change in the natural world,&#x201D; she says.In May, Recombinetics moved one step closer to commercializing its technology, announcing a partnership with Canadian semen distributor Semex. The two companies plan to spend the next few years working with regulators in Canada and the U.S. Absent significant obstacles, we may live in a world in 20 years in which no cow would ever need to be dehorned, Carlson says. &#x201C;Whether this strain of animals takes off, it&#x2019;s really up to the government and public acceptance,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I can&#x2019;t do a lot about those things. I&#x2019;ve just got to do my job.&#x201D;","inner_url":[{"title":"Next Jobs","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/next-jobs","type":"other"}]},"10e6ecd9caf7ee28b3526efbe6fbce71":{"category":"technology","header":"The Glamorous Life of a Pro Gamer","subheader":"Teams are dolling out signing bonuses, big salaries and housing to attract the best teens and twenty-somethings in the $1.5 billion esports industry.","str_time":"June 21, 2018, 5:47 AM","text":"In 2011, Dorothy Schmale dropped off her 14-year-old son at the Port Authority bus terminal in New York City.

Now, here she was, sending him off on a 13-plus-hour bus ride to Columbus, Ohio, where he would compete in his first major tournament for Call of Duty. &#x201C;It was hard for me to let him go,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;But that&#x2019;s really when I knew this was going to take off.&#x201D;Six years later, Michael Schmale (also known as SpaceLy) signed a contract to represent a newly formed organization called Ghost Gaming, which announced it was paying him and each of his teammates a $4,000 monthly salary, as well as a shared $50,000 signing bonus. More impressive still were the perks: Ghost housed them in a 10-bedroom mansion that overlooks Hollywood and, incidentally, was formerly occupied by Justin Bieber.&#xA0;Ghost, which generates most of its revenue from tournament prize money and sponsorships, also supplied the recruits with a coach, team manager, general manager, chef and personal trainers. The trainers were there to knock the sun-deprived, posture-challenged gamers into shape (Schmale spent the first week of the workouts throwing up until he learned to skip breakfast beforehand).

The esports industry brought in $1.5 billion in revenue last year and is expected to generate $2.3 billion by 2022, according to SuperData, which tracks the industry. All of that money has finally made professional video gaming an actual career for young people around the world. For example, the 50 starting players who entered this year&#x2019;s North American League of Legends Championship Series were guaranteed a minimum salary of $75,000, with the average player earning about $320,000. &#xA0;  QuicktakeCompetitive Video GamingOver the next six months, Bloomberg will produce a series of mini-documentaries about gigs like these. We&#x2019;re calling the series Next Jobs. Economists have made all kinds of predictions for how innovations including artificial intelligence will kill jobs. Long before self-driving cars threatened to displace cab drivers, modern telephones displaced switchboard operators and automobiles made coachmen redundant. Those advances were painful for the people forced to find new professions, but didn&#x2019;t result in mass unemployment. That&#x2019;s partly because new jobs emerged too.&#xA0;Once again, careers unimaginable only a generation ago are popping up around the world. Some may fade away as quickly as they appeared; others could become as ubiquitous as app developers are now. It&#x2019;s impossible to know ahead of time. But spotting these budding careers now may give us a peek into the labor market that the next generation will enter.&#xA0;Many of these emerging jobs are exciting&#x2013;and, in Michael Schmale&#x2019;s case, glamorous&#x2013;but they&#x2019;re risky, too. Despite the uncertainty of his new gig, &#xA0;Schmale was unfazed. &#x201C;I understand how uncharted it is, that it could change tomorrow,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s just the type of person I am.&#x201D;&#xA0;","inner_url":[{"title":"Quicktake Competitive Video Gaming","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2017-06-23\/why-competitive-video-gaming-is-the-hot-new-thing-quicktake-q-a","type":"article"}]},"76551b25e37f97bacef3ff68929bd237":{"category":"technology","header":"What Happened When One Startup Tried Affirmative Action Hiring","subheader":"Making the hire was just the first step in building a more inclusive workplace.","str_time":"June 12, 2018, 5:00 AM","text":"Subscribe to&#xA0;Decrypted&#xA0;on Apple&#xA0;PodcastsSubscribe to&#xA0;Decrypted&#xA0;on Pocket Casts&#xA0;When entrepreneur Mitchell Lee decided it was time to hire another engineer at his startup&#xA0;Penny, he set out to hire someone who broke the mold of a typical Silicon Valley&#xA0;programmer.

That cut a contrast to the diplomatic and tight-lipped approach used by more senior executives such as Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg.                      {\"contentId\":\"PCSVW96JTSEU01\",\"position\":\"box\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[300,250],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"Mobile Body Box Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"box1\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-01\/facebook-s-top-security-executive-exits-amid-fake-accounts-probe\"},\"containerId\":\"box-vwcZg4x\"}                               &#x201C;I have been proud to work with some of the most skilled and dedicated security professionals in the world in one of the most difficult threat environments faced by any technology company,&#x201D; Stamos wrote. &#x201C;It is critical that we as an industry live up to our collective responsibility to consider the impact of what we build.&#x201D;The latest disclosure from Facebook came on Tuesday, when the company said it had identified a new batch of accounts that were trying to stir up political discord in the U.S. ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Facebook hasn&#x2019;t identified who is behind the new accounts.The tactics used in this campaign are more sophisticated than the relatively crude methods used by the Russian government-linked Internet Research Agency in 2016, the company said. The new discovery shows how difficult it has been to stop bad actors from exploiting social media in an effort to influence political opinions. Facebook has ramped up security spending and hired an army of new moderators to better police its global site.Stamos is the latest high-profile executive to say he plans to leave Menlo Park, California-based Facebook this year. The company is also losing its chief counsel, Colin Stretch, and head of policy, Elliot Schrage, both of whom were also involved in helping the company deal with the fallout from Russian political interference.","inner_url":[{"title":"Facebook Inc.","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/FB:US","type":"company"},{"title":"initially joined","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2015-06-24\/facebook-hires-away-yahoo-s-chief-information-security-officer","type":"article"},{"title":"disclosure","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-07-31\/facebook-finds-ongoing-evidence-of-election-interference","type":"article"}]},"cb19dbf65bf94a6f96c44dc850d845f2":{"category":"technology","header":"Blue Apron Shares Tumble on Decline in Revenue, Customers","str_time":"August 2, 2018, 9:05 AM","key_point":["Meal-kit service quarterly sales missed lowest estimates","Customers declined 24% from a year earlier amid competition"],"text":"Blue Apron Holdings Inc. shares tumbled the most ever after the meal-kit company reported a decline in customers and projected further deterioration in revenue this year, underscoring the struggle to hit its stride since last year&#x2019;s initial public offering.The New York-based company said customers fell 24 percent in the second quarter, reversing gains made in the previous period. The number of people purchasing its signature boxes of food to make home-cooked meals dropped 9 percent from the first quarter to 717,000. The average order value also dipped from a year earlier to $57.34.Fewer customers led to a 25 percent decrease in revenue for the period ending June 30.

The company also had problems at its fulfillment center, which was plagued by delays.The shares fell as much as 24 percent in New York Thursday to $1.85. It was the biggest drop since the company&#x2019;s June 2017 IPO.Blue Apron Chief Executive Officer Brad Dickerson called 2018 &#x201C;a year of transition and building for the future.&#x201D; On a conference call to discuss earnings, Blue Apron said it expects revenue of $150 million to $160 million in the third quarter, which would mark as much as a 29 percent decline from the year-earlier period. Analysts&#x2019; had been expecting $204.3 million.&#x201C;With fulfillment center operations strengthening, we are increasing focus on the priorities we expect will propel revenue performance and return the business to a growth trajectory,&#x201D; said Dickerson, who took over late last year.In the coming months, Blue Apron plans to expand its direct-to-consumer offerings through new channels, Dickerson said. The company will test on-demand delivery via its own e-commerce platform and third-party delivery partners, beginning on the East and West coasts.

While it&#x2019;s unclear how much they still own, continuing donations of Amazon stock to their charitable foundation suggest they still control a healthy chunk of the world&#x2019;s second-most valuable company.They&#x2019;ve donated 595,027 shares to the Bezos Family Foundation from 2001 through 2016, according to filings available on GuideStar, which collects data on nonprofits. The 25,000 shares they gifted in 2016 were worth about $20 million at the time. The foundation focuses on education for young people.If they haven&#x2019;t sold or donated anything else, the pair would own about 16.6 million shares, or 3.4 percent of the firm, making them the second-biggest individual owners after their son. Their total return in that case would be about 12,000,000 percent, a performance that would make even the most celebrated venture capitalists blush. SoftBank&#x2019;s $20 million bet on Alibaba has returned about 720,000 percent since 2000, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Sequoia Capital&#x2019;s WhatsApp investment returned roughly 36,000 percent by the time Facebook Inc. bought the messaging service for $22 billion in 2014.                      {\"contentId\":\"PCFN896K50XU01\",\"position\":\"in-article\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[5,19],[300,250],[1,1]],\"tablet\":[[5,19],[728,90],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"In Article Flex Native Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"in-article\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-07-31\/a-hidden-amazon-fortune-bezos-parents-could-be-worth-billions\"},\"containerId\":\"in-article-jhIcEIy\"}                               &#x201C;We were fortunate enough that we have lived overseas and we have saved a few pennies so we were able to be an angel investor,&#x201D; Mike Bezos, a Cuban immigrant who also goes by Miguel, said in Philadelphia. &#x201C;The rest is history.&#x201D;He bought 582,528 shares in February 1995, according to the 1997 prospectus. Five months later, Jackie Bezos bought 847,716 shares. The wider Bezos family held this stock through four trusts at the end of 1999, another filing shows. The Jacklyn Gise Bezos 1996 Revocable Trust held 8.9 million shares, followed by the Miguel A. Bezos 1996 Revocable Trust with 4.8 million shares, while the Bezos Family Trust and the Bezos Generation Skipping Trust held 2.9 million and 675,000, respectively.Any self-respecting wealth adviser likely would have pressed the family to diversify their holdings given the &quot;heightened consequences of such extreme individual company exposures,&quot; according to Eduardo Gruener, co-founder of Miami-based multi-family office GFG Capital.Siblings&#x2019; WindfallAfter applying historic selling patterns and accounting for the disclosed donations, Jackie and Mike Bezos would still control $10 billion of shares, according to an analysis by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That&#x2019;s on top of their son&#x2019;s $147 billion fortune, which easily makes him the world&#x2019;s richest person. He&#x2019;s added $48 billion to his fortune so far in 2018 as Amazon shares have risen 52 percent through July 30.Even if they had unwound all of their Amazon holdings at the lowest possible price, they still would have reaped about $100 million.The filing also suggests a windfall for Jeff Bezos&#x2019; siblings Mark and Christina. They each bought 30,000 Amazon shares for $10,000 in 1996. If they haven&#x2019;t sold any of those shares, their stakes would be worth about $640 million apiece.The Bezos Family Foundation didn&#x2019;t respond to email and telephone messages requesting comment. Amazon declined to comment.Wozniak&#x2019;s LargesseWith Amazon, Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. approaching market values of $1 trillion, the world could have myriad unknown tech billionaires. Only corporate insiders or shareholders with stakes exceeding 5 percent are required to report their interests. In the case of Apple, that means individuals with positions up to $46.7 billion wouldn&#x2019;t be required to disclose their holdings.Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak held a 7.9 percent stake in 1980, which shrank over time as he sold options at low prices to mid-level employees and gifted shares to those he felt had been shortchanged. His remaining stake is thought to be in the millions rather than billions.Or take Google parent Alphabet. An early investor was reportedly none other than Jeff Bezos, who put $250,000 of his own money into the internet-search startup in 1998, according to the New Yorker. Those shares, valued at about $280 million at the IPO, would be worth more than $8 billion today.That pales in comparison to the returns potentially reaped by his parents, who hit the jackpot backing their boy.&#x201C;Extraordinary returns don&#x2019;t come around often&#x201D; said Gruener, the wealth adviser.&#x201C;Replace Amazon with nearly any other name in the market and the ending may have turned out as a nightmare.&#x201D;For more on Amazon&#x2019;s success, check out the&#xA0;Decrypted&#xA0;podcast:                                                             &#x2014; With assistance by Spencer Soper","inner_url":[{"title":"Jeff Bezos","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/billionaires\/id\/1642252","type":"other"},{"title":"Paul Allen","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/billionaires\/id\/1402424","type":"other"},{"title":"Bloomberg Billionaires Index","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/billionaires\/","type":"other"}]},"b44584c5cc59284bba0cb497b7124964":{"category":"technology","header":"Bitcoin Whale's Bad Trade Leaves Counterparties Holding the Bag","str_time":"August 3, 2018, 3:24 AM","key_point":["Hong Kong-based exchange OKEx forces traders to take haircut","The episode underscores risks of lightly regulated venues"],"text":"A massive wrong-way bet on Bitcoin left an unidentified futures trader unable to cover losses, burning counterparties and threatening to dent confidence in one of the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency venues.The long position in Bitcoin futures listed on OKEx, a Hong Kong-based exchange, had a notional value of about $416 million, according to an OKEx statement on Friday and data compiled by Bloomberg.

To do that, it must grow its share of an intensely competitive yet slowing market. Huawei will need to lure even more buyers away from competitors in already saturated markets like China and Europe, which Xiaomi Corp. and Oppo are also targeting.Longer term, Huawei also needs to address its absence from the U.S., a failing writ large after attempts to sell smartphones through AT&amp;T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and Best Buy Co. collapsed amid U.S. security concerns.

This news got an&#xA0;&#x201C;lol&#x201D; from my son.&#xA0;I got up and started walking again but stopped outside my destination to look again, at which point I learned that shortstop Marcus Semien had mucked things up by scoring the sixth run, although Lucroy did cross home plate a few seconds later to make it 7-0. This merited a &#x201C;shoot.&#x201D;It was a moment of baseball bliss (not to mention father-son bonding)&#xA0;in a summer during which the A&#x2019;s have afforded many of them. The team is doing that thing it has done every few years during the nearly 21-year tenure of general manager Billy Beane: that&#xA0;thing where an unheralded, mostly underpaid assortment of players starts winning game after game after game. But I&#x2019;m not here to write about &#x201C;Moneyball,&#x201D; the book and movie that put Beane on the business-conference speaking circuit (I have in the past).

Soccer fans in the U.K., they found, report much bigger declines in happiness after their team loses a game than gains in happiness after their team wins. As the Washington Post&apos;s Wonkblog put it in the headline of a post that summarized the study, &quot;British economists prove it: Sports destroy happiness.&quot;The study is a testament to the inventiveness of modern empirical economics. Dolton and MacKerron used data from the Mappiness iPhone app                                               2                       created by MacKerron and Susana Mourato of the London School of Economics, which pings users a couple of times a day,                                               3                       asks them how they&#x2019;re feeling, who they&#x2019;re with, where they are and what they&#x2019;re doing, and also&#xA0;figures out their approximate location from the iPhone&#x2019;s global positioning system and a noise-level measure. They sifted the Mappiness data&#xA0;to identify soccer fans and figure out which teams they probably supported, then scraped the internet for game times, scores and betting data (to indicate which team was expected to win). Really, it is all quite impressive.I nonetheless find it hard to&#xA0;believe that&#xA0; sports truly does destroy happiness, at least for most fans. This is partly for the list of possible reasons that Dolton and MacKerron include at the end of their paper, such as mismeasurement and the pleasure derived from &#x201C;being in a tribe.&#x201D; But it&#x2019;s also because I would guess that most people who follow sports are smart enough to do it in ways that don&#x2019;t leave them utterly bereft when a particular&#xA0;team loses.The Atlantic&#x2019;s Derek Thompson outlined one approach in May, that of rooting for teams that, you know, win:Rooting for winners is more than acceptable&#x2014;it&#x2019;s commendable. Fans shouldn&#x2019;t put up with awfully managed teams for decades just because their parents liked those teams, as if sports were governed by the same rules and customs as medieval inheritance. Fans should feel free to shop for teams the way they do for any other product.Thompson to some extent inherited his fair-weather fandom&#xA0;from an uncle who indoctrinated him at an early age as a supporter of the incomparably successful New York Yankees. But while I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;s wrong about the merits of rooting for winners, there are diminishing returns. Dolton and MacKerron found that the happiness boost from a win is smaller and the happiness decrease from a loss greater if your team is expected to win. I can attest from personal experience that the mood at home football games&#xA0;at the University of Alabama, which is&#xA0;expected to win pretty much every time, is weirdly tense and dour.                                               4                                            {\"contentId\":\"PD1S9W6S972B01\",\"position\":\"in-article\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[5,19],[300,250],[1,1]],\"tablet\":[[5,19],[728,90],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"In Article Flex Native Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"in-article\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/view\/articles\/2018-08-06\/sports-fandom-doesn-t-have-to-make-you-miserable-all-the-time\"},\"containerId\":\"in-article-qNCJdWI\"}                               There is a way, though, to get mostly good vibes out of sports&#xA0;without forgoing underdog victories and abandoning&#xA0;childhood loyalties. Let&#x2019;s call it nonbinary fandom. In my (Oakland A&#x2019;s-centric) experience, it consists of three main elements:\tAssemble a portfolio of teams. My attachment to the A&#x2019;s stems mainly from the fact that I grew up near Oakland,                                               5                       but it didn&#x2019;t hurt that my first years as a fan coincided with three straight World Series triumphs. When A&#x2019;s owner Charlie Finley subsequently jettisoned most of the team&#x2019;s stars and the A&#x2019;s fell to 63-98 in 1977, I turned my attention across the bay to the San Francisco Giants, who weren&#x2019;t great but were at least better than that. When the A&#x2019;s started winning again in the early 1980s, I went back to focusing on them. When the two teams met in the World Series in 1989, I favored the A&#x2019;s (who won in an earthquake-interrupted sweep), but I was thrilled when the Giants won their first World Series in 76 years in 2010. This is a variant of fair-weather fandom that, like Harry Markowitz&#x2019;s  portfolio theory, involves not picking one best team but two or more teams that will presumably be good at different times. It&#x2019;s not foolproof, and to some extent I was just lucky in picking two frequently if not overwhelmingly successful franchises.                                               6                      &#xA0;But if you come to a sport without any childhood allegiances, as I did with Premier League soccer upon moving to London in 2000, you can be strategic about this.&#xA0;For various reasons, I chose&#xA0;perennially mediocre                                               7                       West Ham as &#x201C;my team,&#x201D; and I will surely be over the moon if they ever win anything significant, but I quietly adopted much-more-successful Liverpool and somewhat-more-successful Tottenham as backups.\tRoot for players, not just teams.&#xA0;Being an A&#x2019;s fan&#xA0;has long entailed watching beloved players go on to riches and success elsewhere. In the 1970s, when Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter and other A&#x2019;s&#xA0;stars left for bigger-spending&#xA0;teams, I was offended&#xA0;by this. Since then, and especially since Beane&#xA0;took over as general manager in 1997, I&#x2019;ve gotten used to it, as have most A&#x2019;s fans. When former A&#x2019;s players return to the Oakland Coliseum in an opposing team&#x2019;s uniform, they usually get a warm reception, not boos.&#xA0;I wrote   a column in 2015&#xA0;arguing that Beane&#x2019;s frequent personnel changes had become a major source of entertainment for A&#x2019;s fans during down years. The bigger&#xA0;entertainment value since then for me, though, has probably come from watching&#xA0;two of my favorite former A&#x2019;s, Yoenis Cespedes&#xA0;of the New York Mets and Josh Reddick of the Houston Astros, during the 2015 and 2017&#xA0;World Series.                                               8                       More generally, appreciating great athletes, and cheering them on when they&#x2019;re facing any team but one of your own, seems like a reliable happiness-increaser.&#xA0;\tYou don&#x2019;t have to&#xA0;pay attention. If the A&#x2019;s were having bad season, I wouldn&#x2019;t have bothered to stop in the park and check the score last Wednesday. I spend far more time on the A&#x2019;s during winning seasons than losing ones. So much more that, when the successful A&#x2019;s teams of recent decades have finished their seemingly inevitable playoff collapses, my disappointment has been followed within a few hours by a sense of relief and near-elation that I can stop spending so much danged time watching baseball. Maybe this is the key: I&#x2019;m not a die-hard sports fan. True die-hards probably really are miserable.                                                                Lucroy hasn&apos;t always been light-hitting, but this year he&apos;s batting .247 with two home runs, so I think that&apos;s a fair description.

Two times a day is the default, but users can choose to be pinged more or less frequently.                                                                                       I haven&apos;t been to an Alabama game since the 1990s, but I imagine things have only gotten worse since Nick Saban took over as coach and turned the team into a barely stoppable juggernaut.                                                                                       My dad had been a fan of the team in their Philadelphia days, but wasn&apos;t (and isn&apos;t) exactly a zealot about it.                                                                                       It also seems harder to do with the A&#x2019;s and Giants now that the teams face off every year (which didn&#x2019;t happen before interleague play was introduced in 1997), which has shifted what was once a friendly-neighbor relationship into more of a rivalry.

The effort springs from a deeply misguided and flawed understanding of markets, technology, venture capital and local politics.A few words on this topic might offer some insight. If Council members were to better understand the history of New York&#x2019;s horrible taxi service -- and the Council&#x2019;s own role in creating this mess -- they might see why attempts to thwart market forces will only make things worse.As I noted before, Uber NYC launched on May 4, 2011. It became wildly successful for a few simple reasons we discussed last time:I blame the artificially low numbers of medallions for almost all of New York&#x2019;s taxi industry&#x2019;s woes. The credit for that -- and for creating a market opportunity for Uber -- belongs to the TLC (Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission) and the medallion owners. Consider, the number of licensed cabs was about 16,900 in 1937, when the city&#x2019;s&#xA0;population&#xA0;was more than 1 million lower than it is today. Today, there are fewer&#xA0;medallions&#xA0;than 80 years ago. There have been only about 1,800 new medallions issued&#xA0;since 1996.                      {\"contentId\":\"PD1PSD6TTDS101\",\"position\":\"box\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[300,250],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"Mobile Body Box Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"box1\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/view\/articles\/2018-08-06\/uber-is-blamed-for-the-mistakes-of-new-york-s-leaders\"},\"containerId\":\"box-bWlmtFQ\"}                               Much of the Council&apos;s confused thinking about for-hire cars services was summed up in a New York Times op-ed last week. Council member Adrienne Adams made a number of claims, many of which amount to little more than advocating on behalf of medallion owners and Yellow Cab drivers and against the ride-hailing apps:In recent years these cars have flooded New York, clogging our streets and driving down fares and with them, income for tens of thousands of drivers. Professional drivers, more than 90 percent of whom are immigrants of color, once earned a middle-class living but now face eviction, bankruptcy and even hunger. In the last year six of them have committed suicide.This is simply an emotional set of claims, rife with denominator blindness, and lacking any sort of rational basis for evaluation. Perhaps we can change her perspective with some context.Where some people see a flood of cars &quot;clogging our streets,&#x201D; other see a huge improvement in car availability. Hailing a car was previously a challenge even under the best of circumstances. Let it rain, or be near the time when cab drivers change shifts, and availability plummeted&#xA0;to zero.Adams argues that declining fares is a bad thing; others see lower costs of transportation&#xA0;for millions of New Yorkers. She laments the decline in wages for drivers; I see that as proof of the artificial monopoly that the T&amp;LC created for drivers and medallion owners, limiting the supply of cars in the face of overwhelming market demand.                      {\"contentId\":\"PD1PSD6TTDS101\",\"position\":\"outstream\",\"dimensions\":{\"large_desktop\":[[1,8]],\"small_desktop\":[[1,8]],\"tablet\":[[1,8]]},\"strategy\":\"always\",\"type\":\"Outstream Video Native Ad\",\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"outstream\",\"url\":\"\/view\/articles\/2018-08-06\/uber-is-blamed-for-the-mistakes-of-new-york-s-leaders\"},\"containerId\":\"outstream-video-1-PD1PSD6TTDS101\"}                               Indeed, many of those drivers determined that the deal the medallion owners offer them was actually a bad one, and they have migrated to Uber and&#xA0; Lyft&#xA0;to take greater control of their own financial destinies and working conditions. The Council should be encouraging this sort of entrepreneurship, not penalizing it.                      {\"contentId\":\"PD1PSD6TTDS101\",\"position\":\"in-article\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[5,19],[300,250],[1,1]],\"tablet\":[[5,19],[728,90],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"In Article Flex Native Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"in-article\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/view\/articles\/2018-08-06\/uber-is-blamed-for-the-mistakes-of-new-york-s-leaders\"},\"containerId\":\"in-article-gvQwam4\"}                               Adams, an African-American, also acknowledges that people of color are frequently ignored by Yellow Cabs. But she offers a bizarre explanation&#xA0;for this crime, claiming that &#x201C;racism against blacks is often one of the first things that immigrants learn when they arrive in America.&#x201D; App-based ride hailing services radically improves availability of cabs for those people who otherwise have been discriminated against when they try to hail a cab from the curbside.Last, it is a tragedy when anyone takes their own life. The U.S., with a population of about 325&#xA0;million people, has a distressing 45,000 suicides a year (0.014 percent of the population). It is tragic that six drivers out of 50,000 with Yellow Cab licenses ended their own lives -- but the fact is this is about the same rate as the general population (0.012 percent). Using this tragedy to fabricate an emotional plea doesn&apos;t move the argument forward.Uber says it doesn&apos;t charge a service fee if a customer tips a driver via the app. Numerous drivers have claimed otherwise. If the New York City Council wants to protect the incomes of drivers, it should mandate that 100 percent of tips given&#xA0;by passengers actually go to the driver. Among the remedies the city is turning to&#xA0;is a temporary cap on the number of hide-hail app cars, which will give the city time to study how many cars are really need to meet consumer demand while setting minimum pay for maintaining full-time driver incomes. I suppose some of this is not objectionable: Statisticians will tell you that more data -- not less -- makes for better studies and analyses.Yet here is the grim reality: at some date in the future, and perhaps not that far off, there will be no more cab drivers. You will hail a self-driving car via an app, and safely and efficiently be taken to your destination. Accidents caused by human error, drowsiness and driving while drunk, will be reduced or eliminated.The focus on the short-term well-being of a small group of workers -- at the expense of the rest of the public -- misses the bigger picture.","inner_url":[{"title":"Read more opinion","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/view\/contributors\/AEq0WJRomcY\/barry-l-ritholtz\/articles","type":"other"}]},"38f2f017066547adfcb6c9afcceee213":{"category":"Technology & Ideas","header":"How America Can Stop Being the Wild West of Data","subheader":"It can\u2019t follow Europe\u2019s example.

For the U.S., a new set of proposals from Senator Mark Warner might point the way forward.In many ways, Europe has been the global standard-setter in regulating big data. Since 1995, it has strictly limited how personal information can be used. For the most part, if Europeans give a specific entity permission to collect their data for a specific use, that&#x2019;s where it stops. Information gleaned from a person&apos;s activity on a social network, for example, cannot be repurposed to make credit decisions.Europe&apos;s new General Data Protection Regulation extends and strengthens those principles, empowering people to move their data from one company to another, or to be forgotten completely. Companies that don&#x2019;t comply face hefty penalties. Computer algorithms that, say, deliver ads or assess job candidates must be defensible as &#x201C;appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures.&#x201D; If people think they&#x2019;re being treated unfairly, they can demand that a human provide an explanation.                                               1                                                     {\"contentId\":\"PCZO4H6TTDS001\",\"position\":\"outstream\",\"dimensions\":{\"large_desktop\":[[1,8]],\"small_desktop\":[[1,8]],\"tablet\":[[1,8]]},\"strategy\":\"always\",\"type\":\"Outstream Video Native Ad\",\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"outstream\",\"url\":\"\/view\/articles\/2018-08-05\/how-america-can-stop-being-the-wild-west-of-data\"},\"containerId\":\"outstream-video-1-PCZO4H6TTDS001\"}                                            {\"contentId\":\"PCZO4H6TTDS001\",\"position\":\"box\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[300,250],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"Mobile Body Box Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"box1\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/view\/articles\/2018-08-05\/how-america-can-stop-being-the-wild-west-of-data\"},\"containerId\":\"box-xLbELVK\"}                               America can&#x2019;t adopt a regime like Europe&#x2019;s, because it has long taken a much more laissez-faire approach. Except for specific cases such as medical records, personal information is up for grabs as soon as people allow anyone to collect it. All one needs to do is click &#x201C;I agree&#x201D; on a smartphone app, and the hoovering starts. A robust industry has sprung up to warehouse data, create profiles and sell them to whoever wants to know, for pretty much any purpose. It&#x2019;s the Wild West.This is good and bad. Conveniences accumulate when everyone&#x2019;s data is out there: Drivers, for example, benefit greatly from apps such as Waze, which uses data gleaned from myriad smartphones to discern traffic patterns and give better directions. But Americans also expose themselves to exploitation &#x2014; for instance, when insurers use data on consumption habits to predict health costs, and potentially to jack up health insurance payments.Here&#x2019;s where Warner&#x2019;s white paper, Potential Policy Proposals for Regulation of Social Media and Technology Firms, comes in. It&#x2019;s a stew of competing and conflicting suggestions, but overall it leans toward a sensible approach. Instead of limiting or cutting off data collection, it seeks to level the playing field.Consider Facebook:&#xA0;It&#x2019;s hard for new social networks or messaging apps to compete, because the company already has everyone&#x2019;s information. So one proposal suggests giving new entrants access to Facebook&#x2019;s friend networks, or at least making the information easy for users to port to a competitor. This is a kind of antitrust regulation that doubles down on data availability rather than stifling it.As regards algorithms, Warner&#x2019;s approach would be more focused than Europe&#x2019;s, targeting those that might have the biggest effect on people&#x2019;s lives. The government, for example, could require that algorithms making decisions about credit, housing and employment be audited for fairness and bias. Also, people should be able to see and correct the data that go into the computer. If such requirements make the process less efficient, that &#x201C;seems an acceptable cost to promote greater fairness, auditability, and transparency.&#x201D;                      {\"contentId\":\"PCZO4H6TTDS001\",\"position\":\"in-article\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[5,19],[300,250],[1,1]],\"tablet\":[[5,19],[728,90],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"In Article Flex Native Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"in-article\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/view\/articles\/2018-08-05\/how-america-can-stop-being-the-wild-west-of-data\"},\"containerId\":\"in-article-MexuzoQ\"}                               There&#x2019;s no guarantee that any of this will become law, and even then only time will how well it would work. We&#x2019;re in uncharted territory. But given how much of Americans&#x2019; personal data is already out there, Warner&#x2019;s proposals are probably the best possible approach.                                                                Of course, that all begs the question, how can such requirements be enforced? What kind of explanation is necessary, for example? Speaking as a former hedge fund quant, I can think of a few ways to give an explanation that is, by construction, meaningless. Similarly, who&#x2019;s in charge of deciding whether a formula is appropriate? The same people who designed it?

Beijing has been pushing policy to fuel the rise of EVs, giving owners registration breaks and offering tax incentives for buyers. And while other countries are making inroads, China will remain the leader through at least 2040, Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts.

The automaker has already boosted prices on its Model S and Model X cars by as much as $30,000 in China after the government imposed additional duties on American-built vehicles.That risks putting them out of reach for the country&#x2019;s growing middle class. Encouraging for Tesla, though, EV demand is strongest in China&#x2019;s largest cities, which have imposed restrictions on gasoline-engine cars.Places like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are also home to China&#x2019;s wealthiest consumers, the people that are more likely to afford a Tesla either now -- or down the road -- especially as the company rolls out the Model 3 sedan, its cheapest-ever car.

Maybe that organization got lucky in that this code found its way into the fabs of Taiwan&#x2019;s most-important company, instead of some lesser-known chipmaker elsewhere.Twelve months ago, Taiwan suffered blackouts that impacted some areas. I wrote a column relaying the anecdote of  a friend who&#x2019;d wished that TSMC had been impacted (it wasn&#x2019;t), because only then would the government be spurred into action to fix a looming power crisis that threatens the island&#x2019;s&#xA0;economy and security. A similar kind of schadenfreude comes to mind here. Maybe&#xA0;TSMC is the&#xA0;victim of some software stupidity. Maybe I&#x2019;m&#xA0;getting ahead of myself and have been influenced by too many stories of corporate targets from various state actors&#x2019; ongoing cyber campaigns.Or maybe, like the impending&#xA0;power crisis,&#xA0;TSMC is the canary in the coalmine, and&#xA0;Taiwan needs to take a hitherto&#xA0;hidden problem seriously.","inner_url":[{"title":"Read more opinion","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/view\/contributors\/AOZ1cdFX8mo\/tim-culpan\/articles","type":"other"},{"title":"over the weekend","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-08-05\/iphone-chipmaker-races-to-recover-after-crippling-computer-virus","type":"article"},{"title":"a friend who&#x2019;d wished that TSMC had been impacted","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/gadfly\/articles\/2017-08-16\/worry-about-this-taiwan-power-vacuum","type":"other"}]},"cf3e27352f2cc136b265d98c8b11e8e2":{"category":"hyperdrive","header":"Elon Musk Says Sorry, Starts Acting Like a Real CEO","str_time":"August 1, 2018, 9:43 PM","key_point":["CEO apologizes to two analysts for behavior on earlier call","Carmaker burns through less money as Model 3 output picks up"],"text":"Elon Musk may have been on to something when he said Tesla Inc. was becoming a real car company. Just as importantly for investors, he&#x2019;s acting more like a real CEO.After Tesla reported burning through less cash than Wall Street feared in the second quarter, Musk apologized to the two analysts he scorned three months earlier for asking &#x201C;bonehead&#x201D; and &#x201C;dry&#x201D; questions on the company&#x2019;s previous earnings call. The performance was well received: Tesla shares surged 16 percent, the biggest jump since December 2013.Bulls are betting the results and the contrition mark a turning point both for Tesla and its chief executive officer. After struggling mightily to mass-manufacture a car for the first time, the company is gaining momentum with the Model 3 sedan that&#x2019;s critical to its bid to start making money. The 47-year-old Musk also delivered for the supporters who called for him to show more poise and execute after months of distracting and destructive behavior.                      {\"contentId\":\"PCT8T8SYF01S01\",\"position\":\"box\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[300,250],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"Mobile Body Box Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"box1\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-02\/musk-s-mea-culpa-and-relief-over-cash-marks-tesla-turning-point\"},\"containerId\":\"box-Ha7lJkZ\"}                               &#x201C;The pieces are now falling into place for a sustainable Tesla story.

Stemming the tide was a major focal point of skeptics who were alarmed by the more than $1 billion in cash the company went through in three of the previous four quarters.&#x201C;I was impressed with their negative free cash flow,&#x201D; said David Kudla, CEO of Mainstay Capital Management, which is betting against Tesla. Still, with the company building some Model 3 cars manually under a tent outside its assembly plant and struggling to keep customers happy in major markets like Norway, the fund manager isn&#x2019;t convinced the company is out of the woods. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m more concerned about quality issues and service issues,&#x201D; Kudla said.Capital Concerns Eased                      {\"contentId\":\"PCT8T8SYF01S01\",\"position\":\"in-article\",\"dimensions\":{\"mobile\":[[5,19],[300,250],[1,1]],\"tablet\":[[5,19],[728,90],[1,1]]},\"type\":\"In Article Flex Native Ad\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"targeting\":{\"position\":\"in-article\",\"positionIncrement\":1,\"url\":\"\/news\/articles\/2018-08-02\/musk-s-mea-culpa-and-relief-over-cash-marks-tesla-turning-point\"},\"containerId\":\"in-article-Mu5bFGI\"}                               Musk has been adamant that Tesla won&#x2019;t need to raise more capital this year. Many analysts have questioned how long he can stay insistent, citing lingering doubts that the company can sustain higher Model 3 production levels and afford to pay off some of the liabilities looming on its balance sheet.The CEO set out to address these concerns both in a letter to shareholders and on the call. He and Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja wrote that they expected Tesla to build as many as 55,000 Model 3s this quarter, which would nearly double output from the three months that ended in June. Then, Musk told an analyst the company would start paying off its debts.&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t mean refi-ing them, I mean paying them off,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;There&#x2019;s a convert that&#x2019;s coming due soon -- a couple hundred million, $900 million, something like that -- we expect to pay that off with internally generated cash flow, and still have a healthy cash balance.&#x201D;Tesla ended June with about $2.2 billion in cash, the least it&#x2019;s carried since the first quarter of 2016. While Musk flaunted plans to get Tesla&#x2019;s fiscal house in order, he also might end up raising some capital after all. The company probably will use &#x201C;essentially a loan from the local banks&#x201D; in China to fund a new factory it&#x2019;s building in Shanghai, he said on the call.Bloomberg News reported earlier Wednesday that the company would look to China to at least partially fund the car and battery plant where it intends to invest $5 billion, citing a person familiar with the plans. Spending won&#x2019;t begin &#x201C;in any significant way&#x201D; until next year, according to the shareholder letter. Musk said it may only cost about $2 billion in capital expenditures for the factory to be able to build 250,000 vehicles a year.Fremont FixationFor almost a year, Tesla followers fixated on the company&#x2019;s target to make 5,000 Model 3s in a week. After a struggle Musk blamed in part on relying too much on automation, the carmaker put off expenditures toward doubling that rate until it was achieved.Tesla pulled out all the stops to finally hit that goal at the end of June, flying in a production line from Germany on a cargo plane, adopting an around-the-clock schedule and erecting a massive tent to house another assembly line in the parking lot of its California plant.Now that the company finally hit the target, it&#x2019;s reviving a goal to make 10,000 a week sometime in 2019. A year ago, the goal was to get there in 2018.Tesla is renewing the target even as Musk and Ahuja tout having &#x201C;significantly cut back&#x201D; on spending projections. The CEO carried out a reorganization last quarter and announced that 9 percent of the company&#x2019;s workforce would be dismissed.The measures Tesla has been taking may be what bears point to as evidence that the company has been taking short-term steps only to support the perception that its outlook is improving, said Alexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Jaffray with a buy rating on the shares.&#x201C;Only time will tell, but in our view, today&#x2019;s results were clearly a step in the right direction,&#x201D; he wrote in a report to clients. &#x201C;A few years from now, investors may conclude that 2Q18 was the quarter in which Tesla cemented its position as a truly formidable player in the global automotive market.&#x201D;&#x2014; With assistance by Molly Smith, Brian Eckhouse, Tom Randall, Gabrielle Coppola, Edward Ludlow, and Sarah Gardner","inner_url":[{"title":"Elon Musk","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/billionaires\/id\/1954518","type":"other"},{"title":"Tesla Inc.","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/quote\/TSLA:US","type":"company"},{"title":"real car company","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-07-01\/text-of-elon-musk-s-email-to-tesla-employees-after-hitting-goal","type":"article"},{"title":"apologized","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-08-01\/musk-s-apology-to-analysts-he-scorned-sends-tesla-stock-soaring","type":"article"},{"title":"distracting","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-08-01\/tesla-s-phantom-shooter-the-strange-story-of-a-debunked-threat","type":"article"},{"title":"destructive behavior","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-07-17\/tesla-bull-tells-elon-musk-to-temper-his-concerning-behavior","type":"article"},{"title":"aims his flamethrowers","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/graphics\/2018-tesla-still-burns-cash\/","type":"other"},{"title":"$1.7 billion short burn","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/terminal\/PCURPZSYF01U","type":"other"},{"title":"strange story","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-08-01\/tesla-s-phantom-shooter-the-strange-story-of-a-debunked-threat","type":"article"},{"title":"give some pause","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/view\/articles\/2018-08-01\/tesla-tsla-q2-earnings-the-drama-s-not-over","type":"other"},{"title":"like Norway","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-07-24\/norwegians-quietly-revolt-against-tesla","type":"article"},{"title":"reported","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-08-01\/tesla-is-said-to-plan-5-billion-investment-in-chinese-factory","type":"article"},{"title":"automation","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-04-13\/musk-tips-his-tesla-cap-to-humans-after-robots-undercut-model-3","type":"article"},{"title":"from Germany","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-02-07\/tesla-slows-red-hot-cash-burn-on-model-3-progress-deposit-boost","type":"article"},{"title":"around-the-clock","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-04-17\/tesla-moves-to-24-7-model-3-production-to-hit-6-000-a-week-goal","type":"article"},{"title":"massive tent","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-06-25\/the-future-of-tesla-hinges-on-this-gigantic-tent","type":"article"},{"title":"9 percent","url":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-06-12\/tesla-cutting-about-9-of-workers-on-musk-s-profitability-push","type":"article"}]},"08e9384c6ab99200d0582d47af5209fe":{"category":"hyperdrive","header":"Tesla Takes Its Foot Off the Cash-Burn Pedal","str_time":"August 1, 2018, 4:47 PM","text":"Despite production headaches, Tesla Inc. burned through less cash than expected in the second quarter and stood firm with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk&#x2019;s projection that profit is around the corner after years of losses.
